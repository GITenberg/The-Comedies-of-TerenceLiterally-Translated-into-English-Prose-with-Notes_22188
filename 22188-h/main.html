About this Translation</a></h4>

<p>The comedies of Terence, translated by Henry Thomas Riley (1816-1878,
B.A. 1840, M.A. 1859), were originally published in 1853 as part of
Bohn’s Classical Library.</p>

<p>The series was later sold to Bell &amp; Daldy, which became George
Bell &amp; sons; it is almost certain that the 1887 edition shown here
was set from the original 1853 plates. The text appeared in an omnibus
volume also containing two translations of the fables of Phaedrus:
Riley’s own, and those of Christopher Smart (1765).</p>

<p>The 1859 Harper’s edition&mdash;issued during Riley’s
lifetime&mdash;omitted the Phaedrus translations. Instead it added
George Colman’s translation of Terence, coincidentally also from 1765.
Only the translations themselves were included, not the notes and
commentary quoted by Riley in his own notes.</p>

<p>The Harper’s edition differs from Bell/Bohn in a few minor points of
spelling and punctuation, but it is very nearly a typographic facsimile
of the London original. Readers who are familiar with the American
edition of Riley’s translation of Ovid’s <i>Metamorphoses</i> should be
reassured to learn that the present text seems to have been much more
carefully composed and typeset.</p>

<h5>The Frontispiece</h5>

<p>The frontispiece shown at the beginning of this e-text is taken from
the Bell/Bohn edition; it is absent from the New York edition. The New
York edition also omitted all illustrations&mdash;including a similar
frontispiece&mdash;from the Colman text.</p>
