THE SUBJECT.</a></h3>

<hr class = "small">

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Chremes</span> and Phania were brothers,
citizens of Athens. Chremes going to Asia, leaves his daughter,
Pasibula, in the care of his brother Phania, who, afterward setting sail
with Pasibula for Asia, is wrecked off the Isle of Andros. Escaping with
their lives, they are kindly received by a native of the island; and
Phania soon afterward dies there. The Andrian changes the name of the
girl to Glycerium, and brings her up, as his own child, with his
daughter Chrysis. On his death, Chrysis and Glycerium sail for Athens to
seek their fortune there. Chrysis being admired by several Athenian
youths, Pamphilus, the son of Simo, an opulent citizen, chances to see
Glycerium, and falls violently in love with her. She afterward becomes
pregnant by him, on which he makes her a promise of marriage. In the
mean time, Chremes, who is now living at Athens, and is ignorant of the
fate of Pasibula, agrees with Simo, the father of Pamphilus, to give
Philumena, another daughter, in marriage to Pamphilus. While these
arrangements are being made, Chrysis dies; on which Simo accidentally
discovers his son’s connection with Glycerium. Chremes, also coming to
hear of it, declines the match, having no idea that Glycerium is really
his own daughter. Simo, however, in order to test his son’s feelings,
resolves to pretend that the marriage-day is fixed. Meeting Pamphilus in
the town, he desires him to go home and prepare for the wedding, which
is to take place immediately. In his perplexity, the youth has recourse
to his servant Davus, who, having heard of the refusal of Chremes,
suspects the design of Simo. At this conjuncture, Charinus,
a&nbsp;friend of Pamphilus, who is enamored of Philumena, but has been
rejected by her father, entreats Pamphilus to put off the marriage, for
at least a few days. Disclosing his own aversion to the match, Pamphilus
readily engages to do this. In order the more effectually to break it
off, Davus advises Pamphilus to pretend a readiness to comply with his
father’s wishes, supposing that of course Chremes will steadily persist
in his refusal. Pamphilus does as he is advised, on which Simo again
applies to Chremes, who, after some entreaty, gives his consent. Just at
this conjuncture, Glycerium is delivered of a son; and by the advice of
Davus, it is laid before the door of Simo’s house. Chremes happening to
see it there, and ascertaining that Pamphilus is its father, again
refuses to give him his daughter. At this moment, Crito, a&nbsp;native
of Andros, arrives, who, being a relative of Chrysis, has come to Athens
to look after her property. Through him, Chremes discovers that
Glycerium is no other than his long-lost daughter, Pasibula; on which he
consents to her immediate marriage with Pamphilus, who promises Charinus
that he will use his best endeavors to obtain for him the hand of
Philumena.</p>

<h5>THE SUMMARY OF C. SULPITIUS APOLLINARIS.</h5>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Pamphilus</span> seduces Glycerium,
wrongfully supposed to be a sister of a Courtesan, an Andrian by birth;
and she having become pregnant, he gives his word that she shall be his
wife; but his father has engaged for him another, the daughter of
Chremes; and when he discovers the intrigue he pretends that the
nuptials are about to take place, desiring to learn what intentions his
son may have. By the advice of Davus, Pamphilus does not resist; but
Chremes, as soon as he has seen the little child born of Glycerium,
breaks off the match, <i>and</i> declines him for a son-in-law.
Afterward, this Glycerium, unexpectedly discovered <i>to be</i> his own
daughter, he bestows as a wife on Pamphilus, the other on Charinus.</p>


<h4 class = "act"><a name = "and_prolog" id = "and_prolog">
THE PROLOGUE.</a></h4>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The</span> poet, when first he applied his
mind to writing, thought that the only duty which devolved on him was,
that the Plays he should compose might please the public. But he
perceives that it has fallen out entirely otherwise; for he is wasting
his labor in writing Prologues, not for the purpose of relating the
plot, but to answer the slanders of a malevolent old Poet.<a class =
"tag" name = "and_tag20" id = "and_tag20" href = "#and_note20">20</a>
Now I beseech you, give your attention to the thing which they impute as
a fault. Menander composed the Andrian<a class = "tag" name =
"and_tag21" id = "and_tag21" href = "#and_note21">21</a>
<span class = "pagenum">6</span>
and the Perinthian.<a class = "tag" name = "and_tag22" id = "and_tag22"
href = "#and_note22">22</a> He who knows either of them well, will know
them both; they are in plot not very different, and yet they have been
composed in different language and style. What suited, he confesses he
has transferred into the Andrian from the Perinthian, and has employed
them as his own. These parties censure this proceeding; and on this
point they differ <i>from him</i>, that Plays ought not to be mixed up
together. By being <i>thus</i> knowing, do they not show that they know
nothing at all? For while they are censuring him, they are censuring
Nævius, Plautus, <i>and</i> Ennius,<a class = "tag" name = "and_tag23"
id = "and_tag23" href = "#and_note23">23</a> whom our <i>Poet</i> has
for his precedents; whose carelessness he prefers to emulate, rather
than the mystifying carefulness<a class = "tag" name = "and_tag24" id =
"and_tag24" href = "#and_note24">24</a> of those parties. Therefore,
I&nbsp;advise them to be quiet in future, and to cease to slander; that
they may not be made acquainted with their own misdeeds. Be well
disposed, then; attend with unbiased mind, and consider the matter, that
you may determine what hope is left; whether the Plays which he shall in
future compose anew, are to be witnessed, or are rather to be driven off
<i>the stage</i>.</p>

that the same has been gratifying to you, I&nbsp;consider

the recital is, as it were, a&nbsp;censure<a class = "tag" name =
"and_tag27" id = "and_tag27" href = "#and_note27">27</a> to one
forgetful of a kindness. But tell me, in one word, what it is that you
want with me.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sim.</span> I’ll do so. In the first place,
in this affair I give you notice: this, which you suppose to be such, is
not a real marriage.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sos.</span> Why do you pretend it then?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sim.</span> You shall hear all the matter
from the beginning; by that means you’ll be acquainted with both my

<span class = "pagenum">8</span>
of life and my own design, and what I want you to do in this affair. For
after he had passed youthfulness,<a class = "tag" name = "and_tag28" id
= "and_tag28" href = "#and_note28">28</a> Sosia, and had obtained free
scope of living, (for before, how could you know or understand his
disposition, while <i>youthful</i> age, fear, <i>and</i> a master<a
class = "tag" name = "and_tag29" id = "and_tag29" href =
"#and_note29">29</a> were checking him?)&mdash;</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sos.</span> That’s true.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sim.</span> What all young men, for the most
part, do,&mdash;devote their attention to some particular pursuit,
either to training horses or dogs for hunting, or to the philosophers;<a
class = "tag" name = "and_tag30" id = "and_tag30" href =
"#and_note30">30</a> in not one of these did he engage in particular
beyond the rest, and yet in all of them in a moderate degree. I&nbsp;was
pleased.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sos.</span> Not without reason; for this I
deem in life to be especially advantageous; that <i>one do</i> nothing
to excess.<a class = "tag" name = "and_tag31" id = "and_tag31" href =
"#and_note31">31</a></p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sim.</span> Such was his mode of life;
readily to bear and to comply with all; with whomsoever he was in
company, to them to resign himself; to devote himself to their pursuits;
at variance with no one; never preferring himself to them. Thus most
readily you may acquire praise without envy, and gain friends.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sos.</span> He has wisely laid down his rule
of life; for in these days obsequiousness begets friends; sincerity,
dislike.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sim.</span> Meanwhile, three years ago,<a
class = "tag" name = "and_tag32" id = "and_tag32" href =
"#and_note32">32</a> a certain woman from
<span class = "pagenum">9</span>
Andros removed hither into this neighborhood, driven by poverty and the
neglect of her relations, of surpassing beauty and in the bloom of
youth.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sos.</span> Ah! I’m afraid that this Andrian
will bring some mischief.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sim.</span> At first, in a modest way, she
passed her life with thriftiness and in hardship, seeking a livelihood
with her wool and loom. But after an admirer made advances, promising
her a recompense, <i>first</i> one and then another; as the disposition
of all mankind has a downward tendency from industry toward pleasure,
she accepted their proposals, <i>and</i> then began to trade <i>upon her
beauty</i>. Those who then were her admirers, by chance, as it
<i>often</i> happens, took my son thither that he might be in their
company. Forthwith I <i>said</i> to myself, “He is surely caught; he is
smitten.”<a class = "tag" name = "and_tag33" id = "and_tag33" href =
"#and_note33">33</a> In the morning I used to observe their servant-boys
coming or going away; I&nbsp;used to make inquiry, “Here, my lad, tell
me, will you, who had Chrysis yesterday?” for that was the name of the
Andrian (<i>touching <span class = "charname">Sosia</span> on the
arm</i>).</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sos.</span> I understand.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sim.</span> Phædrus, or Clinias, or
Niceratus, they used to say; for these three then loved her at the same
time. “Well now, what <i>did</i> Pamphilus <i>do</i>?” “What? He gave
his contribution;<a class = "tag" name = "and_tag34" id = "and_tag34"
href = "#and_note34">34</a> he took part in the dinner.” Just so on
another day I made inquiry, but I discovered nothing whatever that
affected Pamphilus. In fact, I&nbsp;thought him sufficiently proved, and
a great pattern of continence; for he who is brought into
<span class = "pagenum">10</span>
contact with dispositions of that sort, and his feelings are not aroused
even under such circumstances, you may be sure that he is already
capable of undertaking the governance of his own life. This pleased me,
and every body with one voice <i>began</i> to say all <i>kinds of</i>
flattering things, and to extol my <i>good</i> fortune, in having a son
endowed with such a disposition. What need is there of talking? Chremes,
influenced by this report, came to me of his own accord, to offer his
only daughter as a wife to my son, with a very large portion. It pleased
me; I&nbsp;betrothed him; this was the day appointed for the
nuptials.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sos.</span> What then stands in the way? Why
should they not take place?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sim.</span> You shall hear. In about a few
days after these things had been agreed on, Chrysis, this neighbor,
dies.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sos.</span> Bravo! You’ve made me happy. I
was afraid for him on account of Chrysis.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sim.</span> Then my son was often there,
with those who had admired Chrysis; with them he took charge of the
funeral; sorrowful, in the mean time, he sometimes wept <i>with them</i>
in condolence. Then that pleased me. Thus I reflected: “He by reason of
this slight intimacy takes her death so much to heart; what if he
himself had wooed her? What will he do for me his father?” All these
things I took to be the duties of a humane disposition and of tender
feelings. Why do I detain you with many <i>words</i>? Even I myself,<a
class = "tag" name = "and_tag35" id = "and_tag35" href =
"#and_note35">35</a> for his sake, went forth to the funeral, as yet
suspecting no harm.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sos.</span> Ha! what is this?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sim.</span> You shall know. She is brought
out; we proceed. In the mean time, among the females who were there
present, I&nbsp;saw by chance one young woman of beauteous form.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sos.</span> Very likely.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sim.</span> And of countenance, Sosia, so
modest, so charming, that nothing could surpass. As she appeared to me
to lament beyond the rest, and as she was of a figure handsome and
genteel beyond the other women, I&nbsp;approached the female
<span class = "pagenum">11</span>
attendants;<a class = "tag" name = "and_tag36" id = "and_tag36" href =
"#and_note36">36</a> I&nbsp;inquired who she was. They said that she was
the sister of Chrysis. It instantly struck my mind: “Ay, ay, this is it;
hence those tears, hence that sympathy.”</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sos.</span> How I dread what you are coming
to!</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sim.</span> The funeral procession meanwhile
advances; we follow; we come to the burying-place.<a class = "tag" name
= "and_tag37" id = "and_tag37" href = "#and_note37">37</a> She is placed
upon the pile; they weep. In the mean time, this sister, whom I
mentioned, approached the flames too incautiously, with considerable
danger. There, at that moment, Pamphilus, in his extreme alarm,
discovers his well-dissembled and long-hidden passion; he runs up,
clasps the damsel by the waist. “My Glycerium,” says he, “what are you
doing? Why are you going to destroy yourself?” Then she, so that you
might easily recognize their habitual attachment, weeping, threw herself
back upon him&mdash;how affectionately!</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sos.</span> What do you say?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sim.</span> I returned thence in anger, and
hurt at heart: and <i>yet there was</i> not sufficient ground for
reproving him. He might say; “What have I done? How have I deserved
<i>this</i>, or offended, father? She who wished to throw herself into
the flames, I&nbsp;prevented; I&nbsp;saved her.” The defense is a
reasonable one.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sos.</span> You judge aright; for if you
censure him who has assisted to preserve life, what are you to do to him
who causes loss or misfortune <i>to it</i>?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sim.</span> Chremes comes to me next day,
exclaiming: “Disgraceful conduct!”&mdash;that he had ascertained that
Pamphilus was keeping this foreign woman as a wife. I&nbsp;steadfastly
denied that to be the fact. He insisted that it was the fact. In short,
I&nbsp;then left him refusing to bestow his daughter.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sos.</span> Did not you then <i>reprove</i>
your son?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sim.</span> Not even this was a cause
sufficiently strong for censuring him.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sos.</span> How so? Tell me.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">12</span>
<p><span class = "charname">Sim.</span> “You yourself, father,” <i>he
might say</i>, “have prescribed a limit to these proceedings. <i>The
time</i> is near, when I must live according to the humor of another;
meanwhile, for the present allow me to live according to my own.”</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sos.</span> What room for reproving him,
then, is there left?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sim.</span> If on account of his amour he
shall decline to take a wife, that, in the first place, is an offense on
his part to be censured. And now for this am I using my endeavors, that,
by means of the pretended marriage, there may be real ground for
rebuking him, if he should refuse; at the same time, that if <i>that</i>
rascal Davus has any scheme, he may exhaust it now, while <i>his</i>
knaveries can do no harm: who, I&nbsp;do believe, with hands, feet,
<i>and</i> all his might, will do every thing; and more for this, no
doubt, that he may do me an ill turn, than to oblige my son.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sos.</span> For what reason?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sim.</span> Do you ask? Bad heart, bad
disposition. Whom, however, if I do detect&mdash;But what need is there
of talking? If it should turn out, as I wish, that there is no delay on
the part of Pamphilus, Chremes remains to be prevailed upon by me; and I
do hope that all will go well. Now it’s your duty to pretend these
nuptials cleverly, to terrify Davus; and watch my son, what he’s about,
what schemes he is planning with him.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dav.</span> (<i>aloud to himself.</i>) I was
wondering if this matter was to go off thus; and was continually
dreading where my
<span class = "pagenum">13</span>
master’s good humor would end; for, after he had heard that a wife would
not be given to his son, he never uttered a word to any one of us, or
took it amiss.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sim.</span> (<i>apart, overhearing him.</i>)
But now he’ll do <i>so</i>: and that, I&nbsp;fancy, not without heavy
cost to you.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dav.</span> (<i>to himself.</i>) He meant
this, that we, thus unsuspecting, should be led away by delusive joy;
that now in hope, <i>all</i> fear being removed, we might during our
supineness be surprised, so that there might be no time for planning a
rupture of the marriage. How clever!</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sim.</span> (<i>apart.</i>) The villain!
what does he say?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dav.</span> (<i>overhearing him, to

<p><span class = "charname">Dav.</span> About what?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sim.</span> Do you ask the question? There’s
a report that my son’s in love.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sim.</span> Will you attend to this, or

<p><span class = "charname">Dav.</span> Certainly, I <i>will</i>, to
that.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sim.</span> But for me to inquire now into
these matters, were the part of a severe father. For what he has done
hitherto, doesn’t concern me at all. So long as his time <i>of life</i>
prompted to that course, I&nbsp;allowed him to indulge his inclination:
now this day brings on another mode of life, demands other habits. From
this time forward, I&nbsp;do request, or if it is reasonable, I&nbsp;do
entreat you, Davus, that he may now return to the <i>right</i> path.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dav.</span> (<i>aside.</i>) What can this

Davus, there’s no room for slothfulness or inactivity, so far as I’ve
just now ascertained the old man’s mind about the marriage; which if it
is not provided against by cunning, will be bringing either myself or my
master to ruin. What to do, I&nbsp;am not determined; whether I should
assist Pamphilus or obey the old man. If I desert the former,
I&nbsp;fear for his life; if I assist him, I&nbsp;<i>dread</i>
<span class = "pagenum">15</span>
the other’s threats, on whom it will be a difficult matter to impose. In
the first place, he has now found out about this amour; with hostile
feelings he watches me, lest I should be devising some trickery against
the marriage. If he discovers it, I’m undone; or even <i>if</i> he
chooses to allege any pretext, whether rightfully or wrongfully, he will
consign me headlong to the mill. To these evils this one is besides
added for me. This Andrian, whether she is <i>his</i> wife, or whether
<i>his</i> mistress, is pregnant by Pamphilus. It is worth while to hear
their effrontery; for it is an undertaking <i>worthy</i> of those in
their dotage, not of those who dote in love;<a class = "tag" name =

a&nbsp;merchant; he was shipwrecked off the Isle of Andros; he died.
<i>They say</i> that there, the father of Chrysis, on that occasion,
sheltered this girl, thrown on shore, an orphan, a&nbsp;little child.
What nonsense! To myself at least it isn’t very probable; the fiction

may withdraw wretched me from Glycerium. If this is effected, I&nbsp;am

an affair of such importance! Passing me in the Forum just now, he said,
“Pamphilus, you must be married to-day: get ready; be off home.” He
seemed to me to say this: “Be off this instant, and go hang yourself.”
I&nbsp;was amazed; think you that I was able to utter a single word, or
any excuse, even a frivolous, false, <i>or</i> lame one? I&nbsp;was
speechless. But if any one were to ask me now what I would have done, if
I had known this sooner, <i>why</i>, I&nbsp;would have done any thing
rather than do this. But now, what course shall I first adopt? So many
cares beset me, which rend my mind to pieces; love, sympathy for her,
the worry of this marriage; then, respect for my father, who has ever,
until now, with such an indulgent disposition, allowed me to do whatever
was agreeable to my feelings. Ought I to oppose him? Ah me! I&nbsp;am in
uncertainty what to do.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Mys.</span> (<i>apart.</i>) I’m wretchedly
afraid how this uncertainty is to terminate. But now there’s an absolute
necessity, either for him to speak to her, or for me <i>to speak</i> to
him about her. While the mind is in suspense, it is swayed by a slight
impulse one way or the other.</p>

my mind. Now at the point of death, she called me; I&nbsp;went to her;
you had withdrawn; we were alone; she began: “My dear Pamphilus, you see
her beauty and her <i>youth</i>; and it is not unknown to you to what
extent both of these are now of use to her, in protecting both her
chastity and her interests. By this right hand I do entreat you, and by

has been obedient to you in all things. You do I give to her as a
husband, friend, protector, father. This property of mine do I intrust

<p><span class = "charname">Pam.</span> How do you know?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dav.</span> You shall know. Your father just
now laid hold of me; he said that a wife was to be given you to-day, and
many other things as well, which just now I haven’t time to relate.
Hastening to you immediately, I&nbsp;ran on to the Forum that I might
tell you these things. When I didn’t find you, I&nbsp;ascended there to
a high place.<a class = "tag" name = "and_tag51" id = "and_tag51" href =
"#and_note51">51</a> I&nbsp;looked around; you were nowhere. There by
chance I saw Byrrhia, his <i>servant</i> (<i>pointing to <span class =

hadn’t seen you. This puzzled me. I&nbsp;considered what I was to do. As
I was returning in the mean time, a&nbsp;surmise from the circumstances
themselves occurred to me: “How now,&mdash;a very small amount of good
cheer; he out of spirits; a&nbsp;marriage all of a sudden; <i>these
things</i> don’t agree.”</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Pam.</span> But to what purpose this?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dav.</span> I forthwith <i>betook</i> myself
to the house of Chremes. When I arrived there&mdash;stillness before the

<p><span class = "charname">Pam.</span> Proceed.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dav.</span> I stopped <i>there</i>. In the

house,<a class = "tag" name = "and_tag53" id = "and_tag53" href =

<p><span class = "charname">Pam.</span> I think not, Davus.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dav.</span> Think, do you say? You don’t

<p><span class = "charname">Pam.</span> What then does my father mean?
Why does he <i>thus</i> make pretense?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dav.</span> I’ll tell you. If now he were
angry <i>with you</i>, because Chremes will not give you a wife, he
would seem to himself to be unjust, and that not without reason, before
he has ascertained your feelings as to the marriage, how they are
disposed. But if you refuse to marry her, in that case he will transfer
the blame to you; then such disturbances will arise.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Pam.</span> I will submit to any thing
<i>from him</i>.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dav.</span> He is your father, Pamphilus. It
is a difficult matter. Besides, this woman is defenseless. No sooner
said
<span class = "pagenum">25</span>
than done; he will find some pretext for driving her away from the
city.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Pam.</span> Driving her away?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dav.</span> <i>Aye</i>, and quickly too.</p>

to do?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dav.</span> Say that you will marry her.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Pam.</span> (<i>starting.</i>) Ha!</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dav.</span> What’s the matter?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Pam.</span> What, am I to say so?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dav.</span> Why not?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Pam.</span> Never will I do it.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dav.</span> Don’t say so.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Pam.</span> Don’t attempt to persuade
me.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dav.</span> Consider what will be the result
of it.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Pam.</span> That I shall be deprived of the
one, <i>and</i> fixed with the other.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dav.</span> Not so. In fact, I think it will
be thus: Your father will say: “I wish you to marry a wife to-day.” You
reply: “I’ll marry her.” Tell me, how can he raise a quarrel with you?
Thus you will cause all the plans which are now arranged by him to be
disarranged, without any danger; for this is not to be doubted, that
Chremes will not give you his daughter. Therefore do not hesitate in
those measures which you are taking, on this account, lest he should
change his sentiments. Tell your father that you consent; so that
although he may desire it, he may not be able to be angry at you with
reason. For that which you rely on, I&nbsp;will easily refute; “No one,”
<i>you think</i>, “will give a wife to <i>a person of</i> these habits.”
But he will find a beggar for you, rather than allow you to be corrupted
<i>by a mistress</i>. If, however, he shall believe that you bear it
with a contented mind, you will render him indifferent; at his leisure
he will look out for another <i>wife for you</i>; in the mean time
something lucky may turn up.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Pam.</span> Do you think so?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dav.</span> It really is not a matter of

<p><span class = "charname">Sim.</span> She didn’t order in their

she has come out, she bawls from the street to those who are in the

to you so very well suited to be thus openly imposed upon
<span class = "pagenum">32</span>
by your tricks? At all events <i>it should have been</i> with
precaution; that at least I might have seemed to be feared if I should
detect it.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dav.</span> (<i>aside.</i>) Assuredly, upon
my faith, it’s he that’s now <i>deceiving</i> himself, not I.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sim.</span> I gave you warning, I
forbade you with threats to do it. Have you been awed? What has it
availed? Am I to believe you now in this, that this woman has had a
child by Pamphilus?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dav.</span> (<i>aside.</i>) I understand
where he’s mistaken; and I see what I must do.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sim.</span> Why are you silent?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dav.</span> What would you believe? As
though word had not been brought you that thus it would happen.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sim.</span> Any <i>word brought</i> to
me?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dav.</span> Come now, did you of your own
accord perceive that this was counterfeited?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sim.</span> I am being trifled with.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dav.</span> Word has been brought you; for
<i>otherwise</i> how could this suspicion have occurred to you?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sim.</span> How? Because I knew you.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dav.</span> As though you meant to say that
this has been done by my contrivance.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sim.</span> Why, I’m sure of it, to a
certainty.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dav.</span> Not yet even do you know me
sufficiently, Simo, what sort of person I am.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sim.</span> I, not <i>know</i> you!</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dav.</span> But if I begin to tell
<i>you</i> any thing, at once you think that deceit is being practiced
upon you in guile; therefore, upon my faith, I&nbsp;don’t dare now
<i>even</i> to whisper.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sim.</span> This one thing I am sure of,
that no person has been delivered here. (<i>Pointing to <span class =
"charname">Glycerium’s</span> house.</i>)</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dav.</span> You have discovered <i>that</i>?
Still, not a bit the less will they presently be laying the child<a
class = "tag" name = "and_tag63" id = "and_tag63" href =
"#and_note63">63</a> here before the door. Of this, then, I&nbsp;now
warn you, master, that it will happen,
<span class = "pagenum">33</span>
that you may be aware of it. Don’t you hereafter be saying that this was
done through the advice or artifices of Davus. I&nbsp;wish this
suspicion of yours to be entirely removed from myself.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sim.</span> How do you know that?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dav.</span> I’ve heard so, and I believe it:
many things combine for me to form this conjecture. In the first place
then, she declared that she was pregnant by Pamphilus; that has been
proved to be false.<a class = "tag" name = "and_tag64" id = "and_tag64"
href = "#and_note64">64</a> Now, when she sees that preparations are
being made for the wedding at our house, the maid-servant is directly
sent to fetch the midwife to her, and to bring a child at the same
time.<a class = "tag" name = "and_tag65" id = "and_tag65" href =
"#and_note65">65</a> Unless it is managed for you to see the child, the
marriage will not be at all impeded.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sim.</span> What do you say <i>to this?</i>
When you perceived that they were adopting this plan, why didn’t you
tell Pamphilus immediately?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dav.</span> Why, who has induced him to
leave her, but myself? For, indeed, we all know how desperately he loved
her. Now he wishes for a wife. In fine, do you intrust me with that
affair; proceed however, as before, to celebrate these nuptials, just as
you are doing, and I trust that the Gods will prosper this matter.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sim.</span> Very well; be off in-doors; wait
for me there, and get ready what’s necessary to be prepared. (<i><span
class = "charname">Davus</span> goes into the house.</i>) He hasn’t
prevailed upon me <i>even</i> now altogether to believe these things,
and I don’t know whether what he has said is all true; but I deem it of
little moment; this is of far greater importance to me&mdash;that my son
himself has promised me. Now I’ll go and find Chremes; I’ll ask him for
a wife for my son; if I obtain my request, at what other time rather
than to-day should I prefer these nuptials taking place? For as my son
has promised, I&nbsp;have no doubt but that if he should prove
unwilling, I&nbsp;can fairly compel him. And look! here’s Chremes
himself, just at the very time.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sim.</span> And I for you.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Chrem.</span> You meet me at a welcome
moment. Some persons have been to me, to say that they had heard from
you, that my daughter was to be married to your son to-day; I’ve come to
see whether they are out of their senses or you.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sim.</span> Listen; in a few words you shall
learn both what I want of you, and what you seek <i>to know</i>.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Chrem.</span> I am listening; say what you
wish.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sim.</span> By the Gods, I do entreat you,
Chremes, and <i>by</i> our friendship, which, commencing with our
infancy, has grown up with our years, and by your only daughter and by
my own son (of preserving whom the entire power lies with you), that you
will assist me in this matter; and that, just as this marriage was about
to be celebrated, it may be celebrated.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Chrem.</span> O, don’t importune me; as
though you needed to obtain this of me by entreaty. Do you suppose I am
different now from what I was formerly, when I promised her? If it is
for the advantage of them both that it should take place, order her to
be sent for. But if from this course there would result more harm than
advantage for each, this I do beg of you, that you will consult for
their common good, as though she were your own <i>daughter</i>, and I
the father of Pamphilus.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sim.</span> Nay, so I intend, and so I wish
it to be, Chremes; and I would not ask it of you, did not the occasion
itself require it.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Chrem.</span> What is the matter?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sim.</span> There is a quarrel between

<p><span class = "charname">Sim.</span> So much so, that I’m in hopes

<p><span class = "charname">Chrem.</span> Nonsense!</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sim.</span> It really is so.</p>

that we may prevent it. While an opportunity offers, and while his
passion is cooled by affronts, before the wiles of these women and their
tears, craftily feigned, bring back his love-sick mind to compassion,
let us give him a wife. I&nbsp;trust, Chremes, that, when attached by
intimacy and a respectable marriage, he will easily extricate himself
from these evils.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Chrem.</span> So it appears to you; but I do
not think<a class = "tag" name = "and_tag66" id = "and_tag66" href =
"#and_note66">66</a> that either he can possibly hold to her with
constancy, or that I can put up with it if he does not.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sim.</span> How then can you be sure of
that, unless you make the experiment?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Chrem.</span> But for that experiment to be
made upon a daughter is a serious thing&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sim.</span> Why look, all the inconvenience
in fine amounts to this&mdash;possibly, which may the Gods forfend,
a&nbsp;separation may take place. But if he is reformed, see how many
are the advantages: in the first place, you will have restored a son to
your friend; you will obtain a sure son-in-law<a class = "tag" name =
"and_tag67" id = "and_tag67" href = "#and_note67">67</a> for yourself,
and a husband for your daughter.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Chrem.</span> What is <i>one to say</i> to
all this? If you feel persuaded that this is beneficial, I&nbsp;don’t
wish that any advantage should be denied you.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sim.</span> With good reason, Chremes, have
I always considered you a most valuable friend.</p>

<i>The Megalensian Games</i>)&mdash;These games were instituted at Rome
in honor of the Goddess Cybele, when her statue was brought thither from
Pessinum, in Asia Minor, by Scipio Nasica; they were so called from the
Greek title <span class = "greek" title = "Megalê Mêtêr">Μεγάλη
Μήτηρ</span>, “the Great Mother.” They were called Megalesia or
Megalensia, indifferently. A&nbsp;very interesting account of the origin
of these games will be found in the Fasti of Ovid. B. iv. l. 194, et
seq.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note14" id = "and_note14" href = "#and_tag14">14.</a>
<i>Being Curule Ædiles</i>)&mdash;Among the other offices of the Ædiles
at Rome, it was their duty to preside at the public games, and to
provide the necessary dramatic representations for the Theatre, by
making contracts with the Poets and Actors.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note15" id = "and_note15" href = "#and_tag15">15.</a>
<i>Ambivius Turpio and Lucius Atilius Prænestinus</i>)&mdash;These
persons were the heads or managers of the company of actors who
performed the Play, and as such it was their province to make the
necessary contracts with the Curule Ædiles. They were also actors
themselves, and usually took the leading characters. Ambivius Turpio
seems to have been a favorite with the Roman public, and to have
performed for many years; of L. Atilius Prænestinus nothing is
known.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note16" id = "and_note16" href = "#and_tag16">16.</a>
<i>Freedman of Claudius</i>)&mdash;According to some, the words,
“Flaccus Claudi” mean “the son of Claudius.” It is, however, more
generally thought that it is thereby meant that he was the freedman or
liberated slave of some Roman noble of the family of the Claudii.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note17" id = "and_note17" href = "#and_tag17">17.</a>
<i>Treble flutes and bass flutes</i>)&mdash;The history of ancient
music, and especially that relative to the “tibiæ,” “pipes” or “flutes,”
is replete with obscurity. It is not agreed what are the meanings of the
respective terms, but in the present Translation the following theory
has been adopted: The words “dextræ” and “sinistræ” denote the kind of
flute, the former being <i>treble</i>, the latter <i>bass</i> flutes,
or, as they were sometimes called, “incentivæ” or “succentivæ;” though
it has been thought by some that they were so called because the former
held with the right hand, the latter with the left. When two treble
flutes or two bass flutes were played upon at the same time, they were
called “tibiæ pares;” but when one was “dextra” and the other
“sinistra,” “tibiæ impares.” Hence the words “paribus dextris et
sinistris,” would mean alternately with treble flutes and bass flutes.
Two “tibiæ” were often played upon by one performer at the same time.
For a specimen of a Roman “tibicen” or “piper,” see the last scene of
the Stichus of Plautus. Some curious information relative to the pipers
of Rome and the legislative enactments respecting them will be found in
the Fasti of Ovid, B. vi. l. 653, et seq.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note18" id = "and_note18" href = "#and_tag18">18.</a>
<i>It is entirety Grecian</i>)&mdash;This means that the scene is in
Greece, and that it is of the kind called “palliata,” as representing
the manners of the Greeks, who wore the “pallium,” or outer cloak;
whereas the Romans wore the “toga.” In the Prologue, Terence states that
he borrowed it from the Greek of Menander.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note19" id = "and_note19" href = "#and_tag19">19.</a>
<i>Being Consuls</i>)&mdash;M. Claudius Marcellus and C. Sulpicius Galba

<p><a name = "and_note20" id = "and_note20" href = "#and_tag20">20.</a>
<i>A malevolent old Poet</i>)&mdash;Ver. 7. He alludes to Luscus
Lanuvinus, or Lavinius, a&nbsp;Comic Poet of his time, but considerably
his senior. He is mentioned by Terence in all his Prologues except that
to the Hecyra, and seems to have made it the business of his life to run
down his productions and discover faults in them.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note21" id = "and_note21" href = "#and_tag21">21.</a>
<i>Composed the Andrian</i>)&mdash;Ver. 9. This Play, like that of our
author, took its name from the Isle of Andros, one of the Cyclades in
the Ægean Sea, where Glycerium is supposed to have been born. Donatus,
the Commentator on Terence, informs us that the first Scene of this Play
is almost a literal translation from the Perinthian of Menander, in
which the old man was represented as discoursing with his wife just as
Simo does here with Sosia. In the Andrian of Menander, the old man
opened with a soliloquy.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note22" id = "and_note22" href = "#and_tag22">22.</a>
<i>And the Perinthian</i>)&mdash;Ver. 9. This Play was so called from
Perinthus, a&nbsp;town of Thrace, its heroine being a native of that
place.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note23" id = "and_note23" href = "#and_tag23">23.</a>
<i>Nævius, Plautus, and Ennius</i>)&mdash;Ver. 18. Ennius was the oldest
of these three Poets. Nævius a contemporary of Plautus. See a probable
allusion to his misfortunes in the Miles Gloriosus of Plautus, l.
211.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note24" id = "and_note24" href = "#and_tag24">24.</a>
<i>The mystifying carefulness</i>)&mdash;Ver. 21. By “obscuram
diligentiam” he means that formal degree of precision which is
productive of obscurity.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note25" id = "and_note25" href = "#and_tag25">25.</a>
<i>Are to be taken care of, I&nbsp;suppose</i>)&mdash;Ver. 30. “Nempe ut
curentur recte hæc.” Colman here remarks; “Madame Dacier will have it
that Simo here makes use of a kitchen term in the word ‘curentur.’
I&nbsp;believe it rather means ‘to take care of’ any thing generally;
and at the conclusion of this very scene, Sosia uses the word again,
speaking of things very foreign to cookery, ‘Sat est, curabo.’”</p>

<p><a name = "and_note26" id = "and_note26" href = "#and_tag26">26.</a>
<i>To be my freedman</i>)&mdash;Ver. 37. “Libertus” was the name given
to a slave set at liberty by his master. A&nbsp;“libertinus” was the son
of a “libertus.”</p>

<p><a name = "and_note27" id = "and_note27" href = "#and_tag27">27.</a>
<i>As it were a censure</i>)&mdash;Ver. 43. Among the Greeks (whose
manners and sentiments are supposed to be depicted in this Play) it was
a maxim that he who did a kindness should forget it, while he who
received it should keep it in memory. Sosia consequently feels uneasy,
and considers the remark of his master in the light of a reproach.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note28" id = "and_note28" href = "#and_tag28">28.</a>
<i>After he had passed from youthfulness</i>)&mdash;Ver. 51. “Ephebus”
was the name given to a youth when between the ages of sixteen and
twenty.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note29" id = "and_note29" href = "#and_tag29">29.</a>
<i>And a master</i>)&mdash;Ver. 54. See the Notes to the Translation of
the Bacchides of Plautus, l.&nbsp;109, where Lydus, a&nbsp;slave,
appears as the “pædagogus,” or “magister,” of Pistoclerus.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note30" id = "and_note30" href = "#and_tag30">30.</a>
<i>Or to the philosophers</i>)&mdash;Ver. 57. It was the custom in
Greece with all young men of free birth to apply themselves to the study
of philosophy, of course with zeal proportioned to the love of learning
in each. They each adopted some particular sect, to which they attached
themselves. There is something sarcastic here, and indeed not very
respectful to the “philosophers,” in coupling them as objects of
attraction with horses and hounds.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note31" id = "and_note31" href = "#and_tag31">31.</a>
<i>Nothing to excess</i>)&mdash;Ver. 61. “Ne quid nimis.” This was one
of the three sentences which were inscribed in golden letters in the
Temple of Apollo at Delphi. The two others were “Know thyself,” and
“Misery is the consequence of debt and discord.” Sosia seems from the
short glimpse we have of him to have been a retailer of old saws and
proverbs. He is unfortunately only a Protatic or introductory character,
as we lose sight of him after this Act.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note32" id = "and_note32" href = "#and_tag32">32.</a>
<i>Meanwhile, three years ago</i>)&mdash;Ver. 60. The following remark
of Donatus on this passage is quoted by Colman for its curiosity. “The
Author has artfully said three years, when he might have given a longer
or a shorter period; since it is probable that the woman might have
lived modestly one year; set up the trade the next; and died the third.
In the first year, therefore, Pamphilus knew nothing of the family of
Chrysis; in the second, he became acquainted with Glycerium; and in the
third, Glycerium marries Pamphilus, and finds her parents.”</p>

<p><a name = "and_note33" id = "and_note33" href = "#and_tag33">33.</a>
<i>He is smitten</i>)&mdash;Ver. 78. “Habet,” literally “He has it.”
This was the expression used by the spectators at the moment when a
Gladiator was wounded by his antagonist. In the previous line, in the
words “captus est,” a&nbsp;figurative allusion is made to the
“retiarius,” a&nbsp;Gladiator who was provided with a net, with which he
endeavored to entangle his opponent.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note34" id = "and_note34" href = "#and_tag34">34.</a>
<i>Gave his contribution</i>)&mdash;Ver. 88. “Symbolam.” The “symbolæ,”
“shot” at picnic or club entertainments, are more than once alluded to
in the Notes to the Translation of Plautus.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note35" id = "and_note35" href = "#and_tag35">35.</a>
<i>Even I myself</i>)&mdash;Ver. 116. Cooke remarks here: “A complaisant
father, to go to the funeral of a courtesan, merely to oblige his
son!”</p>

<p><a name = "and_note36" id = "and_note36" href = "#and_tag36">36.</a>
<i>The female attendants</i>)&mdash;Ver. 123. “Pedissequæ.” These
“pedissequæ,” or female attendants, are frequently alluded to in the
Plays of Plautus. See the Notes to Bohn’s Translation.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note37" id = "and_note37" href = "#and_tag37">37.</a>
<i>To the burying-place</i>)&mdash;Ver. 128. “Sepulcrum” strictly means,
the tomb or place for burial, but here the funeral pile itself. When the
bones were afterward buried on the spot where they were burned, it was
called “bustum.”</p>

<p><a name = "and_note38" id = "and_note38" href = "#and_tag38">38.</a>
<i>Troubles itself about that</i>)&mdash;Ver. 185. He says this
contemptuously, as if it was likely that the public should take any such
great interest in his son as the father would imply by his remark. By
thus saying, he also avoids giving a direct reply.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note39" id = "and_note39" href = "#and_tag39">39.</a>
<i>Davus, not Œdipus</i>)&mdash;Ver. 194. Alluding to the circumstance
of Œdipus alone being able to solve the riddle of the Sphynx.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note40" id = "and_note40" href = "#and_tag40">40.</a>
<i>To the mill</i>)&mdash;Ver. 199. The “pistrinum,” or “hand-mill,” for
grinding corn, was used as a mode of punishment for refractory slaves.
See the Notes to the Translation of Plautus.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note41" id = "and_note41" href = "#and_tag41">41.</a>
<i>Those in their dotage, not those who dote in love</i>)&mdash;Ver.
218. There is a jingle intended in this line, in the resemblance between
“amentium,” “mad persons,” and “amantium,” “lovers.”</p>

<p><a name = "and_note42" id = "and_note42" href = "#and_tag42">42.</a>
<i>They have resolved to rear</i>)&mdash;Ver. 219. This passage alludes
to the custom among the Greeks of laying new-born children on the
ground, upon which the father, or other person who undertook the care of
the child, lifted it from the ground, “tollebat.” In case no one took
charge of the child, it was exposed, which was very frequently done in
the case of female children. Plato was the first to inveigh against this
barbarous practice. It is frequently alluded to in the Plays of
Plautus.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note43" id = "and_note43" href = "#and_tag43">43.</a>
<i>Hence to the Forum</i>)&mdash;Ver. 226. Colman has the following
remark: “The Forum is frequently spoken of in the Comic Authors; and
from various passages in which Terence mentions it, it may be collected
that it was a public place, serving the several purposes of a market,
the seat of the courts of justice, a&nbsp;public walk, and an
exchange.”</p>

<p><a name = "and_note44" id = "and_note44" href = "#and_tag44">44.</a>
<i>Wine-bibbing</i>)&mdash;Ver. 229. The nurses and midwives of
antiquity seem to have been famed for their tippling propensities. In
some of the Plays of Plautus we do not find them spared.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note45" id = "and_note45" href = "#and_tag45">45.</a>
<i>Rearing some monster</i>)&mdash;Ver. 250. “Aliquid monstri alunt.”
Madame Dacier and some other Commentators give these words the rather
far-fetched meaning of “They are hatching some plot.” Donatus, with much
more probability, supposes him to refer to the daughter of Chremes,
whom, as the young women among the Greeks were brought up in great
seclusion, we may suppose Pamphilus never to have seen.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note46" id = "and_note46" href = "#and_tag46">46.</a>
<i>She is oppressed with grief</i>)&mdash;Ver. 268. “Laborat a dolore.”
Colman has the following remark upon this passage: “Though the word
‘laborat’ has tempted Donatus and the rest of the Commentators to
suppose that this sentence signifies Glycerium being in labor,
I&nbsp;can not help concurring with Cooke, that it means simply that she
is weighed down with grief. The words immediately subsequent corroborate
this interpretation; and at the conclusion of the Scene, when Mysis
tells him that she is going for a midwife, Pamphilus hurries her away,
as he would naturally have done here had he understood by these words
that her mistress was in labor.”</p>

<p><a name = "and_note47" id = "and_note47" href = "#and_tag47">47.</a>
<i>By your good Genius</i>)&mdash;Ver. 289. “Per Genium tuum.” This was
a common expression with the Romans, and is used by Horace, Epistles,
B.&nbsp;i., Ep.&nbsp;7:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "poem">
<p>“Quod te per Genium dextramque Deosque Penates,</p>
<p>Obsecro, et obtestor&mdash;”</p>
</div>

<p>The word “Genius” signified the tutelary God who was supposed to
attend every person from the period of his birth. The signification of
the word will be found further referred to in the Notes to the
Translation of Plautus.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note48" id = "and_note48" href = "#and_tag48">48.</a>
<i>To fetch the midwife</i>)&mdash;Ver. 299. Cooke has the following
remark here: “Methinks Mysis has loitered a little too much, considering
the business which she was sent about; but perhaps Terence knew that
some women were of such a temper as to gossip on the way, though an
affair of life or death requires their haste.” Colman thus takes him to
task for this observation: “This two-edged reflection, glancing at once
on Terence and the ladies, is, I&nbsp;think, very ill-founded. The delay
of Mysis, on seeing the emotion of Pamphilus, is very natural; and her
artful endeavors to interest Pamphilus on behalf of her mistress, are
rather marks of her attention than neglect.”</p>

<p><a name = "and_note49" id = "and_note49" href = "#and_tag49">49.</a>
<i>Charinus and Byrrhia</i>). We learn from Donatus that the characters
of Charinus and Byrrhia were not introduced in the work of Menander, but
were added to the Play of Terence, lest Philumena’s being left without a
husband, on the marriage of Pamphilus to Glycerium, should appear too
tragical a circumstance. Diderot is of opinion that Terence did not
improve his Play by this addition.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note50" id = "and_note50" href = "#and_tag50">50.</a>
<i>Tell me nothing</i>)&mdash;Ver. 336. It has been suggested that this
refers to Byrrhia’s dissuading his master from addressing Pamphilus, or
else to what he has told him concerning the intended marriage.
Westerhovius thinks that Byrrhia is just then whispering some trifling
nonsense in his master’s ear, which he, occupied with more important
cares, is unwilling to attend to.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note51" id = "and_note51" href = "#and_tag51">51.</a>
<i>To a high place</i>)&mdash;Ver. 356. He probably alludes to some part
of the Acropolis, the citadel, or higher part of Athens, which commanded
a view of the lower town.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note52" id = "and_note52" href = "#and_tag52">52.</a>
<i>Stillness before the door</i>)&mdash;Ver. 362. Madame Dacier observes
that this remark is very appropriately made by Davus, as showing that
the marriage was clearly not intended by Chremes. The house of the bride
on such an occasion would be thronged by her friends, and at the door
would be the musicians and those who were to form part of the bridal
procession.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note53" id = "and_note53" href = "#and_tag53">53.</a>
<i>No matron at the house</i>)&mdash;Ver. 364. By the use of the word
“matrona,” he probably alludes to the “pronubæ” among the Romans, whose
duties were somewhat similar to those of our bride’s-maids. At the
completion of the bridal repast, the bride was conducted to the bridal
chamber by matrons who had not had more than one husband.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note54" id = "and_note54" href = "#and_tag54">54.</a>
<i>An obol’s worth</i>)&mdash;Ver. 369. The “obelus” was the smallest
Greek silver coin, and was equal in value to about three halfpence of
our money. “Pisciculi minuti,” “little fish,” were much used for food
among the poorer classes; “mena,” a&nbsp;fish resembling our pilchard,
was a common article of food with the Romans. The larger kinds of fish
went under the general name of “cetum.”</p>

<p><a name = "and_note55" id = "and_note55" href = "#and_tag55">55.</a>
<i>I have now followed him</i>)&mdash;Ver. 414. “Hunc venientem sequor.”
Cooke has the following remark on this line: “This verse, though in
every edition, as Bentley judiciously observes, is certainly spurious;
for as Pamphilus has not disappeared since Byrrhia left the stage, he
could not say ‘nunc <i>hunc</i> venientem sequor.’ If we suppose the
line genuine, we must at the same time suppose Terence guilty of a
monstrous absurdity.” On these words Colman makes the following just
observations: “Other Commentators have also stumbled at this passage;
but if in the words ‘followed <i>him</i> hither,’ we suppose
<i>‘him’</i> (hunc) to refer to Simo, the difficulty is removed; and
that the pronoun really does signify Simo, is evident from the
circumstance of Pamphilus never having left the stage since the
disappearance of Byrrhia. Simo is also represented as coming on the
stage homeward, so that Byrrhia might easily have followed him along the
street; and it is evident that Byrrhia does not allude to Pamphilus from
the agreeable surprise which he expresses on seeing him there so
opportunely for the purpose.”</p>

<p><a name = "and_note56" id = "and_note56" href = "#and_tag56">56.</a>
<i>Inflict evil upon me</i>)&mdash;Ver. 431. “Malum;” the usual name by
which slaves spoke of the beatings they were in the habit of receiving
at the hands or by the order of their irascible masters. Colman has the
following remarks: “Donatus observes on this Scene between Byrrhia,
Simo, Pamphilus, and Davus, that the dialogue is sustained by four
persons, who have little or no intercourse with each other; so that the
Scene is not only in direct contradiction to the precept of Horace,
excluding a fourth person, but is also otherwise vicious in its
construction. Scenes of this kind are, I&nbsp;think, much too frequent
in Terence, though, indeed, the form of the ancient Theatre was more
adapted to the representation of them than the modern. The multiplicity
of speeches <i>aside</i> is also the chief error in this dialogue; such
speeches, though very common in dramatic writers, ancient and modern,
being always more or less unnatural.”</p>

<p><a name = "and_note57" id = "and_note57" href = "#and_tag57">57.</a>
<i>What does he say, Davus?</i>)&mdash;Ver. 434. “Quid, Dave, narrat?”
This reading Vollbehr suggests in place of the old one, “Quid Davus
narrat?” and upon good grounds, as it appears. According to the latter
reading we are to suppose that Davus is grumbling to himself, on which
Simo says, “What does Davus say?” It seems, however, much more likely
that Davus accompanies Pamphilus to the door, and speaks to him before
he goes in, and then, on his return to Simo, the latter asks him, “What
does he say, Davus?”</p>

<p><a name = "and_note58" id = "and_note58" href = "#and_tag58">58.</a>
<i>Just as much as nothing</i>)&mdash;Ver. 434. “Æque quidquam nunc
quidem.” This is a circumlocution for “nothing at all:” somewhat more
literally perhaps, it might be rendered “just as much as before.”
Perizonius supplies the ellipsis with a long string of Latin words,
which translated would mean, “Now, indeed, he says equally as much as he
says then, when he says nothing at all.”</p>

<p><a name = "and_note59" id = "and_note59" href = "#and_tag59">59.</a>
<i>Amount of ten drachmæ</i>)&mdash;Ver. 451. The Attic drachma was a
silver coin worth in value about 9¾<i>d.</i> of English money.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note60" id = "and_note60" href = "#and_tag60">60.</a>
<i>Juno Lucina</i>)&mdash;Ver. 473. Juno Lucina had the care of women in
childbed. Under this name some suppose Diana to have been worshiped.
A&nbsp;similar incident to the present is found in the Adelphi, l. 486;
and in the Aulularia of Plautus, l. 646.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note61" id = "and_note61" href = "#and_tag61">61.</a>
<i>Are your scholars forgetful?</i>)&mdash;Ver. 477. He alludes under
this term to Mysis, Lesbia, and Pamphilus, whom he supposes Davus to
have been training to act their parts in the plot against him.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note62" id = "and_note62" href = "#and_tag62">62.</a>
<i>Let her bathe</i>)&mdash;Ver. 483. It was the custom for women to
bathe immediately after childbirth. See the Amphitryon of Plautus,
l.&nbsp;669, and the Note to the passage in Bohn’s Translation.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note63" id = "and_note63" href = "#and_tag63">63.</a>
<i>Be laying the child</i>)&mdash;Ver. 507. Colman has the following
remark on this line:&mdash;“The art of this passage is equal to the
pleasantry, for though Davus runs into this detail merely with a view to
dupe the old man still further by flattering him on his fancied
sagacity, yet it very naturally prepares us for an incident which, by
another turn of circumstances, afterward becomes necessary.”</p>

<p><a name = "and_note64" id = "and_note64" href = "#and_tag64">64.</a>
<i>Proved to be false</i>)&mdash;Ver. 513. That is, according to Simo’s
own notion, which Davus now thinks proper to humor.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note65" id = "and_note65" href = "#and_tag65">65.</a>
<i>To Bring a child at the same time</i>)&mdash;Ver. 515. This is a
piece of roguery which has probably been practiced in all ages, and was
somewhat commonly perpetrated in Greece. The reader of English history
will remember how the unfortunate son of James II was said, in the face
of the strongest evidence to the contrary, to have been a supposititious
child brought into the queen’s chamber in a silver warming-pan.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note66" id = "and_note66" href = "#and_tag66">66.</a>
<i>But I do not think</i>)&mdash;Ver. 563-4. “At ego non posse arbitror
neque illum hane perpetuo habere.” Chremes uses an ambiguous expression
here, perhaps purposely. It may mean, “I do not think that he can
possibly be constant to her,” or, “that she will continue to live with
him.”</p>

<p><a name = "and_note67" id = "and_note67" href = "#and_tag67">67.</a>
<i>A sure son-in-law</i>)&mdash;Ver. 571. By the use of the word
“firmum,” he means a son-in-law who will not be likely to resort to
divorce or separation from his wife.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note68" id = "and_note68" href = "#and_tag68">68.</a>
<i>Why isn’t the bride sent for?</i>)&mdash;Ver. 582. Among the Greeks
the bride was conducted by the bridegroom at nightfall from her father’s
house, in a chariot drawn by a pair of mules or oxen, and escorted by
persons carrying the nuptial torches. Among the Romans she proceeded in
the evening to the bridegroom’s house; preceded by a boy carrying a
torch of white thorn, or, according to some, of pine-wood. To this
custom reference is indirectly made in the present passage.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note69" id = "and_note69" href = "#and_tag69">69.</a>
<i>I myself, indeed!</i>)&mdash;Ver. 597. No doubt Davus says these
words in sorrow and regret; Simo, however, supposes them to be uttered
in exultation at the apparent success of his plans. Consequently “vero”
is intended by Davus to have the sense here of “too truly.”</p>

<p><a name = "and_note70" id = "and_note70" href = "#and_tag70">70.</a>
<i>To a frivolous slave</i>)&mdash;Ver. 610. “Servo futili.” According
to the Scholiast on the Thebais of Statius, B. viii. l. 297, “vas
futile” was a kind of vessel with a broad mouth and narrow bottom, used
in the rites of Vesta. It was made of that peculiar shape in order that
the priest should be obliged to hold it during the sacrifices, and might
not set it on the ground, which was considered profane; as, if set
there, the contents must necessarily fall out. From this circumstance,
men who could not <i>contain</i> a secret were sometimes called
“futiles.”</p>

<p><a name = "and_note71" id = "and_note71" href = "#and_tag71">71.</a>
<i>You scoundrel</i>)&mdash;Ver. 619. “Furcifer;” literally, wearer of
the “furca,” or wooden collar. This method of punishment has been
referred to in the Notes to the Translation of Plautus.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note72" id = "and_note72" href = "#and_tag72">72.</a>
<i>What do you deserve?</i>)&mdash;Ver. 622. Madame Dacier remarks that
this question is taken from the custom of the Athenians, who never
condemned a criminal without first asking him what punishment he thought
he deserved; and according to the nature of his answer they mitigated or
increased his punishment. Tho Commentators quote a similar passage from
the Frogs of Aristophanes.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note73" id = "and_note73" href = "#and_tag73">73.</a>
<i>The cross</i>)&mdash;Ver. 622. The “cross,” “crux,” as a punishment
for refractory slaves has been remarked upon in the Notes to the
Translation of Plautus.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note74" id = "and_note74" href = "#and_tag74">74.</a>
<i>The circumstances</i>)&mdash;Ver. 635. “Res.” According, however, to
Donatus, this word has the meaning here of “malice” or
“spitefulness.”</p>

<p><a name = "and_note75" id = "and_note75" href = "#and_tag75">75.</a>
<i>Concerned in my own interests</i>)&mdash;Ver. 637. Equivalent to our
sayings, “Charity begins at home;” “Take care of number one.”</p>

<p><a name = "and_note76" id = "and_note76" href = "#and_tag76">76.</a>
<i>They are not ashamed</i>)&mdash;Ver. 638. Terence has probably
borrowed this remark from the Epidicus of Plautus, l. 165-6: “Generally
all men are ashamed when it is of no use; when they ought to be ashamed,
then does shame forsake them, when occasion is for them to be
ashamed.”</p>

<p><a name = "and_note77" id = "and_note77" href = "#and_tag77">77.</a>
<i>Makes a noise</i>)&mdash;Ver. 683. The doors with the Romans opened
inwardly, while those of the Greeks opened on the outside. It was
therefore usual with them, when coming out, to strike the door on the
inside with a stick or with the knuckles, that those outside might be
warned to get out of the way. Patrick, however, observes with some
justice, that the word “concrepuit” may here allude to the creaking of
the hinges. See the Curculio of Plautus, l.&nbsp;160, where the
Procuress pours water on the hinges, in order that Cappadox may not hear
the opening of the door.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note78" id = "and_note78" href = "#and_tag78">78.</a>
<i>Take some sacred herbs</i>)&mdash;Ver. 727. “Verbena” appears to have
been a general term applied to any kind of herb used in honor of the
Deities, or to the boughs and leaves of any tree gathered from a pure or
sacred place. Fresh “verbenæ” were placed upon the altars every day. See
the Mercator of Plautus, l.&nbsp;672.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note79" id = "and_note79" href = "#and_tag79">79.</a>
<i>From the altar here</i>)&mdash;Ver. 727. It was usual to have altars
on the stage; when Comedy was performed, one on the left hand in honor
of Apollo, and on the representation of Tragedy, one on the right in
honor of Bacchus. It has been suggested that Terence here alludes to the
former of these. As, however, at Athens almost every house had its own
altar in honor of Apollo Prostaterius just outside of the street door,
it is most probable that to one of these altars reference is here made.
They are frequently alluded to in the Plays of Plautus.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note80" id = "and_note80" href = "#and_tag80">80.</a>
<i>Which I had first purposed, I&nbsp;now give up</i>)&mdash;Ver. 734.
His first intention no doubt was to go and inform Simo of the child
being laid at the door.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note81" id = "and_note81" href = "#and_tag81">81.</a>
<i>Whenever there’s necessity</i>)&mdash;Ver. 737. He retires without
fully explaining his intention to Mysis; consequently, in the next Scene
she gives an answer to Chremes which Davus does not intend.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note82" id = "and_note82" href = "#and_tag82">82.</a>
<i>Stuffed out beneath her clothes</i>)&mdash;Ver. 771. “Suffarcinatam.”
He alludes to the trick already referred to as common among the Greeks,
of the nurses and midwives secretly introducing supposititious children;
see l.&nbsp;515 and the Note.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note83" id = "and_note83" href = "#and_tag83">83.</a>
<i>Several free women were present</i>)&mdash;Ver. 772. She speaks of
“liberæ,”<ins class = "correction" title = "open quote missing">
“</ins>free women,” because in Greece as well as Italy slaves were not
permitted to give evidence. See the Curculio of Plautus, l.&nbsp;621,
and the Note to the passage in Bohn’s Translation. See also the remark
of Geta in the Phormio, <a href =
"terence5_6.html#phor_tag40">l.&nbsp;293</a>.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note84" id = "and_note84" href = "#and_tag84">84.</a>
<i>Constrained by the laws</i>)&mdash;Ver. 782. He alludes to a law at
Athens which compelled a man who had debauched a free-born woman to
marry her. This is said by Davus with the view of frightening Chremes
from the match.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note85" id = "and_note85" href = "#and_tag85">85.</a>
<i>She ought to be carried off</i>)&mdash;Ver. 787. He says this
implying that Mysis, who is a slave, ought to be put to the torture to
confess the truth; as it was the usual method at Athens to force a
confession from slaves by that method. We find in the Hecyra, Bacchis
readily offering her slaves to be put to the torture, and in the Adelphi
the same custom is alluded to in the scene between Micio, Hegio, and
Geta.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note86" id = "and_note86" href = "#and_tag86">86.</a>
<i>Descended to me by law</i>)&mdash;Ver. 800. On the supposition that
Chrysis died without a will, Crito as her next of kin would be entitled
to her effects.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note87" id = "and_note87" href = "#and_tag87">87.</a>
<i> Is Chrysis then&mdash;&mdash;?</i>)&mdash;Ver. 804. This is an
instance of Aposiopesis; Crito, much affected, is unwilling to name the
death of Chrysis. It was deemed of ill omen to mention death, and
numerous Euphemisms or circumlocutions were employed in order to avoid
the necessity of doing so.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note88" id = "and_note88" href = "#and_tag88">88.</a>
<i>Warn me, a stranger</i>)&mdash;Ver. 812. Patrick has the following
remarks upon this passage: “Madame Dacier observes that it appears, from
Xenophon’s Treatise on the policy of the Athenians, that all the
inhabitants of cities and islands in alliance with Athens were obliged
in all claims to repair thither, and refer their cause to the decision
of the people, not being permitted to plead elsewhere. We can not wonder
then that Crito is unwilling to engage in a suit so inconvenient from
its length, expense, and little prospect of success.” She might have
added that such was the partiality and corruptness of the Athenian
people, that, being a stranger, his chances of success would probably be
materially diminished.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note89" id = "and_note89" href = "#and_tag89">89.</a>
<i>You set in motion</i>)&mdash;Ver. 865. By the use of the word
“Commotus” he seems to allude to the wretched, restless existence of a
man tied hand and foot, and continually working at the hand-mill.
Westerhovius thinks that Simo uses this word sarcastically, in allusion
to the words of Davus, at the beginning of the present Scene, “Animo
otioso esse impero;” “I bid you set your minds at ease.”</p>

<p><a name = "and_note90" id = "and_note90" href = "#and_tag90">90.</a>
<i>Hands and feet together</i>)&mdash;Ver. 866. “Quadrupedem.” Literally
“as a quadruped” or “all fours.” Echard remarks that it was the custom
of the Athenians to tie criminal<ins class = "correction" title = "no apostrophe">s </ins>hands and feet together, just like calves.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note91" id = "and_note91" href = "#and_tag91">91.</a>
<i> Without regard to the custom and the law</i>)&mdash;Ver. 880. There
was a law among the Athenians which forbade citizens to marry strangers,
and made the offspring of such alliances illegitimate; the same law also
excluded such as were not born of two citizens from all offices of trust
and honor.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note92" id = "and_note92" href = "#and_tag92">92.</a>
<i>Could opportunely suggest to him</i>)&mdash;Ver. 919. Colman has the
following remark on this line: “Madame Dacier and several English
Translators make Pamphilus say that he could give Crito a hint or two.
What hints he could propose to suggest to Crito, I&nbsp;can not
conceive. The Italian translation, printed with the Vatican Terence,
seems to understand the words in the same manner that I have translated
them, in which sense (the pronoun ‘illum’ referring to Simo instead of
Crito) they seem to be the most natural words of Pamphilus on occasion
of his father’s anger and the speech immediately preceding.”</p>

<p><a name = "and_note93" id = "and_note93" href = "#and_tag93">93.</a>
<i>A sharper</i>)&mdash;Ver. 920. “Sycophanta.” For some account of the
“sycophantæ,” “swindlers” or “sharpers” of ancient times, see the Notes
to the Trinummus of Plautus, Bohn’s Translation.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note94" id = "and_note94" href = "#and_tag94">94.</a>
<i>A long time ago</i>)&mdash;Ver. 924. The story begins with “Olim,”
just in the same way that with us nursery tales commence with “There
was, a&nbsp;long time ago.”</p>

<p><a name = "and_note95" id = "and_note95" href = "#and_tag95">95.</a>
<i>A citizen of Rhamnus</i>)&mdash;Ver. 931. Rhamnus was a maritime town
of Attica, near which many of the more wealthy Athenians had
country-seats. It was famous for the Temple of Nemesis there, the
Goddess of Vengeance, who was thence called “Rhamnusia.” In this Temple
was her statue, carved by Phidias out of the marble which the Persians
brought to Greece for the purpose of making a statue of Victory out of
it, and which was thus appropriately devoted to the Goddess of
Retribution. The statue wore a crown, and had wings, and, holding a
spear of ash in the right hand, it was seated on a stag.</p>

<p><a name = "and_note96" id = "and_note96" href = "#and_tag96">96.</a>
<i>One difficulty</i>)&mdash;Ver. 941. “Scrupus,” or “scrupulus,” was
properly a stone or small piece of gravel which, getting into the shoe,
hurt the foot; hence the word figuratively came to mean a “scruple,”
“difficulty,” or “doubt.” We have a similar expression: “to be
graveled.”</p>

<p><a name = "and_note97" id = "and_note97" href = "#and_tag97">97.</a>
<i>A knot in a bulrush</i>)&mdash;Ver. 942. “Nodum in scirpo quærere”
was a proverbial expression implying a desire to create doubts and
difficulties where there really were none; there being no knots in the
bulrush. The same expression occurs in the Menæchmi of Plautus, l.

<i>Of course&mdash;&mdash;Then be it so</i>)&mdash;Ver. 951. “Nempe id.
Scilicet.” Colman has the following remark on this line: “Donatus, and
some others after him, understand these words of Simo and Pamphilus as
requiring a fortune of Chremes with his daughter; and one of them says
that Simo, in order to explain his meaning, in the representation,
should produce a bag of money. This surely is precious refinement,
worthy the genius of a true Commentator. Madame Dacier, who entertains a
just veneration for Donatus, doubts the authenticity of the observation
ascribed to him. The sense I have followed is, I&nbsp;think, the most
obvious and natural interpretation of the words of Pamphilus and Simo,
which refers to the preceding, not the subsequent, speech of
Chremes.”</p>

<i>He is not rightly bound</i>)&mdash;Ver. 956. “Non recte vinctus;”
meaning “it was not well done to bind him.” The father pretends to
understand him as meaning (which he might equally well by using the same
words), “non satis stricte,” “he wasn’t tightly enough” bound; and
answers “I ordered that he should be,” referring to his order for Davus
to be bound hand and foot. Donatus justly observes that the disposition
of the old gentleman to joke is a characteristic mark of his thorough
reconciliation.</p>

<i>Their joys are their own</i>)&mdash;Ver. 961. Westorhovius remarks
that he seems here to be promulgating the doctrine of Epicurus, who
taught that the Deities devoted themselves entirely to pleasure and did
not trouble themselves about mortals. Donatas observes that these are
the doctrines of Epicurus and that the whole sentence is copied from the
Eunuch of Menander; to which practice of borrowing from various Plays,
allusion is made in the Prologue, where he mentions the mixing of plays;
“contaminari fabulas.”</p>

<i>Grant us your applause</i>)&mdash;Ver. 982. “Plaudite.” Colman has
the following remark at the conclusion of this Play: “All the old
Tragedies and Comedies acted at Rome concluded in this manner. ‘Donec
cantor vos “Plaudite” dicat,’ says Horace. Who the ‘cantor’ was, is a
matter of dispute. Madame Dacier thinks it was the whole chorus; others
suppose it to have been a single actor; some the prompter, and some the
composer. Before the word ‘Plaudite’ in all the old copies is an <span
class = "greek" title = "Ô">Ω</span> which has also given rise to
several learned conjectures. It is most probable, according to the
notion of Madame Dacier, that this <span class = "greek" title =
"Ô">Ω</span>, being the last letter of the Greek alphabet, was nothing
more than the mark of the transcriber to signify the end, like the Latin
word ‘Finis’ in modern books; or it might, as Patrick supposes, stand
for <span class = "greek" title = "Ôdos">Ωδος</span>, ‘cantor,’ denoting
that the following word ‘Plaudite’ was spoken by him. After ‘Plaudite’
in all the old copies of Terence stand these two words, ‘Calliopius
recensui;’ which signify, ‘I,&nbsp;Calliopius, have revised and
corrected this piece.’ And this proceeds from the custom of the old
critics, who carefully revised all Manuscripts, and when they had read
and corrected any work, certified the same by placing their names at the
end of it.”</p>

<hr class = "small">

<p><span class = "smallcaps">A certain</span> citizen of Athens had a
daughter named Pamphila, and a son called Chremes. The former was stolen
while an infant, and sold to a Rhodian merchant, who having made a
present of her to a Courtesan of Rhodes, she brought her up with her own
daughter Thais, who was somewhat older. In the course of years, Thais
following her mother’s way of life, removes to Athens. Her mother dying,
her property is put up for sale, and Pamphila is purchased as a slave by
Thraso, an officer and an admirer of Thais, who happens just then to be
visiting Rhodes. During the absence of Thraso, Thais becomes acquainted
with Phædria, an Athenian youth, the son of Laches; she also discovers
from Chremes, who lives near Athens, that Pamphila, her former
companion, is his sister. Thraso returns, intending to present to her
the girl he has bought, but determines not to do so until she has
discarded Phædria. Finding that the girl is no other than Pamphila,
Thais is at a loss what to do, as she both loves Phædria, and is
extremely anxious to recover Pamphila. At length, to please the Captain,
she excludes Phædria, but next day sends for him, and explains to him
her reasons, at the same time begging of him to allow Thraso the sole
right of admission to her house for the next two days, and assuring him
that as soon as she shall have gained possession of the girl, she will
entirely throw him off. Phædria consents, and resolves to spend these
two days in the country; at the same time he orders Parmeno to take to
Thais a Eunuch and an Æthiopian girl, whom he has purchased for her. The
Captain also sends Pamphila, who is accidentally seen by Chærea, the
younger brother of Phædria; he, being smitten with her beauty, prevails
upon Parmeno to introduce him into the house of Thais, in the Eunuch’s
dress. Being admitted there, in the absence of Thais, he ravishes the
damsel. Shortly afterward Thraso quarrels with Thais, and comes with all
his attendants to her house to demand the return of Pamphila, but is
disappointed. In conclusion, Pamphila is recognized by her brother
Chremes, and is promised in marriage to Chremes; while Thraso becomes
reconciled to Phædria, through the mediation of Gnatho, his
Parasite.</p>

<h5>THE SUMMARY OF C. SULPITIUS APOLLINARIS.</h5>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Captain</span>, Thraso, being ignorant
of the same, has brought <i>from abroad</i> a girl who used wrongly to
be called the sister of Thais, and presents her to <i>Thais</i> herself:
she <i>in reality</i> is a citizen of Attica. To the same woman,
Phædria, an admirer of Thais, orders a Eunuch whom he has purchased, to
be taken, and he himself goes away into the country, having been
entreated to give up two days to Thraso. A&nbsp;youth, the brother of
Phædria, having fallen in love with the damsel sent to the house of
Thais, is dressed up in the clothes of the Eunuch. Parmeno prompts him;
he goes in; he ravishes the maiden; but <i>at length</i> her brother
being discovered, a&nbsp;citizen of Attica, betroths her who has been
ravished, to the youth, <i>and</i> Thraso prevails upon Phædria by his
entreaties.</p>

THE PROLOGUE.</a></h4>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">If</span> there is any one who desires to
please as many good men as possible, and to give offense to extremely
few, among those does our Poet enroll his name. Next, if there is one
who thinks<a class = "tag" name = "eun_tag21" id = "eun_tag21" href =
"#eun_note21">21</a> that language too harsh, is <i>here</i> applied to
him, let him bear this in mind&mdash;that it is an answer, not an
attack; inasmuch as he has himself been the first aggressor; who, by
translating <i>plays</i> verbally,<a class = "tag" name = "eun_tag22" id
= "eun_tag22" href = "#eun_note22">22</a> and writing them in bad
<i>Latin</i>, has made out of good Greek <i>Plays</i> Latin ones by no
means good.
<span class = "pagenum">67</span>
Just as of late he has published the Phasma<a class = "tag" name =
"eun_tag23" id = "eun_tag23" href = "#eun_note23">23</a> [the
Apparition] of Menander; and in the Thesaurus [the Treasure] has

"#eun_note24">24</a> him from whom the gold is demanded, as
<span class = "pagenum">68</span>
pleading his cause why it should be deemed his own, before the person
who demands it <i>has stated</i> how this treasure belongs to him, or
how it came into the tomb of his father. Henceforward, let him not
deceive himself, or fancy thus, “I have now done with it; there’s
nothing that he can say to me.” I&nbsp;recommend him not to be mistaken,
and to refrain from provoking me. I&nbsp;have many other points, as to
which for the present he shall be pardoned, which, <i>however</i>, shall
be brought forward hereafter, if he persists in attacking me, as he has
begun to do. After the Ædiles had purchased the Eunuch of Menander,
<i>the Play</i> which we are about to perform, he managed to get an
opportunity of viewing it.<a class = "tag" name = "eun_tag25" id =
"eun_tag25" href = "#eun_note25">25</a> When the magistrates were
present it began to be performed. He exclaimed that a thief, no Poet,
had produced the piece, but still had not deceived<a class = "tag" name
= "eun_tag26" id = "eun_tag26" href = "#eun_note26">26</a> <i>him</i>;
that, in fact, it was the Colax, an old Play of Plautus;<a class = "tag"
name = "eun_tag27" id = "eun_tag27" href = "#eun_note27">27</a>
<i>and</i> that from it were taken the characters of the Parasite and
the Captain.
<span class = "pagenum">69</span>
If this is a fault, the fault is the ignorance of the Poet; not that he
intended to be guilty of theft. That so it is, you will now be enabled
to judge. The Colax is <i>a Play </i>of Menander’s; in it there is
Colax, a&nbsp;Parasite, and a braggart Captain: he does not deny that he
has transferred these characters into his Eunuch from the Greek; but
assuredly he does deny this, that he was aware that those pieces had
been already translated into Latin. But if it is not permitted <i>us</i>
to use the same characters as others, how can it any more be allowed to
represent hurrying servants,<a class = "tag" name = "eun_tag28" id =
"eun_tag28" href = "#eun_note28">28</a> to describe virtuous matrons,
artful courtesans, the gluttonous
<span class = "pagenum">70</span>
parasite, the braggart captain, the infant palmed off, the old man
cajoled by the servant, about love, hatred, suspicion? In fine, nothing
is said now that has not been said before. Wherefore it is but just that
you should know this, and make allowance, if the moderns do what the
ancients used to do. Grant me your attention, and give heed in silence,
that you may understand what the Eunuch means.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Par.</span> O, is that a matter of
doubt?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Thais</span>. Attend; I entreat you. My
mother died there recently; her brother is somewhat greedy after wealth.
When he saw that this damsel was of beauteous form and understood music,
hoping for a good price, he forthwith put her up for sale, <i>and</i>
sold her. By good fortune this friend of mine was present; he bought her
as a gift to me, not knowing or suspecting any thing of all this. He
returned; but when he perceived that I had formed a connection with you
as well, he feigned excuses on purpose that he might not give her; he
said that if he could feel confidence that he should be preferred to
yourself by me, so as not to apprehend that, when I had received her,
I&nbsp;should forsake him, <i>then</i> he was ready to give her to me;
but that he did fear this. But, so far as I can conjecture, he has set
his affections upon the girl.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phæd.</span> Any thing beyond that?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Thais</span>. Nothing; for I have made
inquiry. Now, my Phædria, there are many reasons why I could wish to get
her away from him. In the first place, because she was called my sister;
moreover, that I may restore and deliver her to her friends. I&nbsp;am a
lone woman; I&nbsp;have no one here, neither acquaintance nor relative;
wherefore, Phædria, I&nbsp;am desirous by my good offices to secure
friends. Prithee, do aid me in this, in order that it may be the more
easily effected. Do allow him for the few next days to have the
preference with me. Do you make no answer?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phæd.</span> Most vile woman! Can I make you
any answer after such behavior as this?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Par.</span> Well done, my <i>master</i>, I
commend you; (<i>aside</i>) he’s galled at last. (<i>To <span class =
"charname">Phædria</span>.</i>) You show yourself a man.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phæd.</span> I was not aware what you were
aiming at; “she was carried away from here, <i>when</i> a little child;
my mother brought her up as though her own; she was called my sister;
I&nbsp;wish to get her away, that I may restore her to her friends.” The
meaning is, that all these expressions, in fine, now amount to this,
<i>that</i> I am shut out, he is admitted. For what reason? Except that
you love him more than me: and now you are afraid of her who has been
brought <i>hither</i>, lest she should win him, such as he is, from
yourself.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Thais</span>. I, afraid of that?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">75</span>
<p><span class = "charname">Phæd.</span> What else, then, gives you
concern? Let me know. Is he the only person who makes presents? Have you
found my bounty shut against you? Did I not, when you told me that you
wished for a servant-maid from Æthiopia,<a class = "tag" name =
"eun_tag36" id = "eun_tag36" href = "#eun_note36">36</a> setting all
other matters aside, go and seek for one? Then you said that you wanted
a Eunuch, because ladies of quality<a class = "tag" name = "eun_tag37"
id = "eun_tag37" href = "#eun_note37">37</a> alone make use of them;
I&nbsp;found <i>you one</i>. I&nbsp;yesterday paid twenty minæ<a class =
"tag" name = "eun_tag38" id = "eun_tag38" href = "#eun_note38">38</a>
for them both. Though slighted by you, I&nbsp;<i>still</i> kept these
things in mind; as a reward for so doing, I&nbsp;am despised by you.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Thais</span>. Phædria, what does this mean?
Although I wish to get her away, and think that by these means it could
most probably be effected; still, rather than make an enemy of you, I’ll
do as you request me.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phæd.</span> I <i>only</i> wish that you
used that expression from your heart and truthfully, “rather than make
an enemy of you.” If I could believe that this was said sincerely,
I&nbsp;could put up with any thing.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Par.</span> (<i>aside.</i>) He staggers; how
instantaneously is he vanquished by a single expression!</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Thais</span>. I, wretched woman, not speak
from my heart? What, pray, did you ever ask of me in jest, but that you
carried your point? I&nbsp;am unable to obtain <i>even</i> this of you,
that you would grant <i>me</i> only two days.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phæd.</span> If, indeed, <i>it is but</i>
two days; but don’t let these days become twenty.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Thais</span>. Assuredly not more than two
days, or&mdash;</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phæd.</span> “Or?” I won’t have it.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Thais</span>. It shall not be; only do allow
me to obtain this of you.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phæd.</span> Of course that which you desire
must be done.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Thais</span>. I love you as you deserve; you
act obligingly.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phæd.</span> (<i>to <span class =
"charname">Parmeno</span>.</i>) I shall go into the country; there I
shall worry myself for the <i>next</i> two days: I’m resolved to do
<span class = "pagenum">76</span>
so; Thais must be humored. Do you, Parmeno, take care that they are
brought hither.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Par.</span> Certainly.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phæd.</span> For the next two days
<i>then</i>, Thais, adieu.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Thais</span>. And the same to you, my
Phædria; do you desire aught else?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phæd.</span> What should I desire? That,
present with the Captain, you may be as if absent; that night and day
you may love me; may feel my absence; may dream of me; may be impatient
for me; may think about me; may hope for me; may centre your delight in

Gods! how much does one man excel another! What a difference there is
between a wise person and a fool! This strongly came into my
<span class = "pagenum">79</span>
mind from the following circumstance. As I was coming along to-day,
I&nbsp;met a certain person of this place, of my own rank and station,
no mean fellow, one who, like myself, had guttled away his paternal
estate; I&nbsp;saw him, shabby, dirty, sickly, beset with rags and
years;&mdash;“What’s the meaning of this garb?” said I; <i>he
answered</i>, “Because, wretch that I am, I’ve lost what I possessed:
see to what I am reduced,&mdash;all my acquaintances and friends forsake
me.” On this I felt contempt for him in comparison with myself. “What!”
said I, “you pitiful sluggard, have you so managed matters as to have no
hope left? Have you lost your wits together with your estate? Don’t you
see me, who have risen from the same condition? What a complexion I
have, how spruce and well dressed, what portliness of person?
I&nbsp;have every thing, <i>yet</i> have nothing; and although I possess
nothing, still, of nothing am I in want.” “But I,” <i>said he</i>,
“unhappily, can neither be a butt nor submit to blows.”<a class = "tag"
name = "eun_tag42" id = "eun_tag42" href = "#eun_note42">42</a> “What!”
<i>said I</i>, “do you suppose it is managed by those means? You are
quite mistaken. Once upon a time, in the early ages, there was a calling
for that class; this is a new mode of coney-catching; I, in fact, have
been the first to strike into this path. There is a class of men who
strive to be the first in every thing, but are not; to these I make my
court; I&nbsp;do not present myself to them to be laughed at; but I am
the first to laugh with them, and at the same time to admire their
parts: whatever they say, I&nbsp;commend; if they contradict that
self-same thing, I&nbsp;commend again. Does any one deny? I&nbsp;deny:
does he affirm? I&nbsp;affirm: in fine, I&nbsp;have <i>so</i> trained
myself as to
<span class = "pagenum">80</span>
humor them in every thing. This calling is now by far the most
productive.”</p>

While we were thus talking, in the mean time we arrived at the

complimented me, asked me to dinner, <i>and</i> gave me a hearty
welcome. When this poor hungry wretch saw that I was in such great
esteem, and that I obtained a living so easily, then the fellow began to
entreat me that I would allow him to learn this <i>method</i> of me;
I&nbsp;bade him become my follower<a class = "tag" name = "eun_tag45" id

she first requested me to be fetched to her (any one might ask me, “What
business had you with her?” Really I don’t know.) When I came, she found
an excuse for me to remain there; she said that she had been offering a

that all these things were being done for her artful purposes. She takes
her place beside me; pays every attention to me; seeks an opportunity of
conversation. When <i>the conversation</i> flagged, she turned off to
this point&mdash;how long since my father and mother died? I&nbsp;said
that it was now a long time ago. Whether I had any country-house at
Sunium, and how far from the sea? I&nbsp;suppose that this has taken her
fancy, <i>and</i> she expects to get it away from me. Then at last,
whether any little sister of mine had been lost from there; whether any
person was with her; what she had about her when she was lost; whether
any one could recognize her. Why should she make these inquiries?
Unless, perhaps, she pretends&mdash;so great is her assurance&mdash;that
she herself is the same person that was formerly lost when a little
girl. But if she is alive, she is sixteen years old, not older;

me earnestly to come. Either let her speak out what she wants, or not be

<p><span class = "charname">Ant.</span> Do you say so?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Chæ.</span> If you saw her, I am sure you

with her. By good luck there was at our house a certain Eunuch, whom my
brother had purchased for Thais, and he had not as yet been sent to her.
On this occasion, Parmeno, our servant, made a suggestion to me, which I
adopted.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">100</span>
<p><span class = "charname">Ant.</span> What was it?</p>

from this plan?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Chæ.</span> Do you ask? That I might see,
hear, and be in company with her whom I loved, Antipho. Is <i>that</i> a
slight motive, or a poor reason? I&nbsp;was presented to <i>the</i>
woman. She, as soon as she received me, joyfully took me home to her
house and intrusted the damsel&mdash;</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Ant.</span> To whom? To you?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Chæ.</span> To me.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Ant.</span> (<i>ironically.</i>) In perfect

<p><span class = "charname">Chæ.</span> (<i>continuing.</i>) “I am going

novices of girls<a class = "tag" name = "eun_tag78" id = "eun_tag78"
href = "#eun_note78">78</a> remained, to be about her. These immediately
made preparations for her to bathe. I&nbsp;urged them to make haste.
While preparations were being made, the damsel sat in a room looking up
at a certain painting,<a class = "tag" name = "eun_tag79" id =

Jove<a class = "tag" name = "eun_tag80" id = "eun_tag80" href =

bosom of Danaë. I&nbsp;myself began to look at it as well, and
<span class = "pagenum">101</span>
as he had in former times played the like game, I&nbsp;felt extremely
delighted that a God should change himself into money, and slily come
through the tiles of another person’s house, to deceive the fair one by
means of a shower. But what God was <i>this</i>? He who shakes the most
lofty temples of heaven with his thunders. Was I, a&nbsp;poor creature
of a mortal,<a class = "tag" name = "eun_tag81" id = "eun_tag81" href =
"#eun_note81">81</a> not to do the same? Certainly, I&nbsp;was to do it,
and without hesitation. While I was thinking over these matters with
myself, the damsel meantime was fetched away to bathe; she went, bathed,
and came back; after which they laid her on a couch. I&nbsp;stood
waiting to see if they gave me any orders. One came up, “Here, Dorus,”
said she, “take this fan,<a class = "tag" name = "eun_tag82" id =
"eun_tag82" href = "#eun_note82">82</a> and let her have a little air in
this fashion, while we are bathing; when we have bathed, if you like,
you may bathe too.” With a demure air I took it.</p>

arrived, she begged the Captain to order him to be admitted; he
immediately began to get into a passion, and yet didn’t dare refuse;
Thais still insisted that he would invite the man in. This she did for
the sake of detaining him; because there was no opportunity <i>just
then</i> of telling him what she wanted to disclose about her sister. He
was invited in, and took his seat. Then she entered into discourse with
him. But the Captain, fancying it was a rival brought before his
<i>very</i> eyes, wanted in his turn to mortify her: “Hark you, boy,”
said he, “go fetch Pamphila, that she may amuse us here.” She exclaimed,
“At a banquet! Certainly not.” The Captain still persisted to a
downright quarrel. Meanwhile my mistress secretly took off her golden

It’s nothing at all. What? Nothing at all? Well now, if I haven’t the

afterward, they both went out together.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Pyth.</span> Now are you quite satisfied
that I am sober, and that we have told you no falsehood? Is it now
sufficiently evident that the girl has been ravished?</p>

(<i><span class = "charname">Dorus</span> steps aside.</i>)
A&nbsp;little further still. That will do. Now tell me this once more;
did Chærea take your clothes off you?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dorus</span>. He did.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phæd.</span> And did he put them on?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dorus</span>. He did.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phæd.</span> And was he brought here instead
of you?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dorus</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phæd.</span> Great Jupiter! O wicked and
audacious fellow!</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Pyth.</span> Woe unto me! Now at last will
you believe that we have been insulted in a disgraceful manner?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phæd.</span> It is no wonder that you
believe what the fellow says. (<i>Aside.</i>) What I’m to do I know not.
(<i>Aside to <span class = "charname">Dorus</span>.</i>) Hark you, deny

truth from you? Did you <i>really</i> see my brother Chærea?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dorus</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phæd.</span> He can’t be brought to confess
without being punished, I&nbsp;see: follow me this way. At one moment he
affirms, at another denies. (<i>Aside.</i>) Ask pardon of me.</p>

impudent fellow. Does this appear a trifle to you, to ravish a virgin,

should be something in this hang-dog’s debt, if I were to do so;
especially as he owns that he is your servant.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Thais</span>. We’ll pass that by. Chærea,
you have behaved unworthily of yourself; for if I am deserving in the
highest degree of this affront, still it is unbecoming of you to be
guilty of it. And, upon my faith, I&nbsp;do not know what method now to
adopt about this girl: you have so confounded all my plans, that I can
not possibly return her to her friends in such a manner as is befitting

Chærea, do a real service to myself.</p>

<i>The Title</i>)&mdash;Colman has the following remark on this Play:
“This seems to have been the most popular of all the Comedies of
Terence. Suetonius and Donatus both inform us that it was acted with the
greatest applause, and that the Poet received a larger price for it from
the Ædiles than had ever been paid for any before, namely, 8000
sesterces, which is about equal to 200 crowns, which in those times was
a considerable sum.”</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note19" id = "eun_note19" href = "#eun_tag19">19.</a>
<i>Acted twice</i>)&mdash;This probably means “twice in one day.” As it
is generally supposed that something is wanting after the figures II,
this is presumed to be “die,” “in one day,” in confirmation of which
Suetonius informs us that it really was performed twice in one day.
Donatus says it was performed three times, by which he may probably
mean, twice on one day and once on another.</p>

<i>Being Consuls</i>)&mdash;M. Valerius Messala and C. Fannius Strabo

him.</p>

<i>By translating literally</i>)&mdash;Ver. 7. “Bene vertendo, at eosdem
scribendo male.” This passage has greatly puzzled some of the
Commentators. Bentley has, however, it appears, come to the most
reasonable conclusion; who supposes that Terence means by “bene
vertere,” a&nbsp;literal translation, word for word, from the Greek, by
which a servile adherence to the idiom of that language was preserved to
the neglect of the Latin idiom; in consequence of which the Plays of
Luscus Lavinius were, as he remarks, “male scriptæ,” written in bad
Latin.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note23" id = "eun_note23" href = "#eun_tag23">23.</a>
<i>Has published the Phasma</i>)&mdash;Ver. 9. The “<span class =
"greek" title = "Phasma">Φασμά</span>,” or “Apparition,” was a play of
Menander, so called, in which a young man looking through a hole in the
wall between his father’s house and that next door, sees a young woman
of marvelous beauty, and is struck with awe at the sight, as though by
an apparition; in the Play, the girl’s mother is represented as having
made this hole in the wall, and having decked it with garlands and
branches that it may resemble a consecrated place; where she daily
performs her devotions in company with her daughter, who has been
privately brought up, and whose existence is unknown to the neighbors.
On the youth coming by degrees to the knowledge that the object of his
admiration is but a mortal, his passion becomes so violent that it will
admit of no cure but marriage, with the celebration of which the Play
concludes. Bentley gives us the above information from an ancient
Scholiast, whose name is unknown, unless it is Donatus himself, which is
doubtful. It would appear that Luscus Lavinius had lately made a
translation of this Play, which, from its servile adherence to the
language of the original, had been couched in ungrammatical language,
and probably not approved of by the Audience. Donatus thinks that this
is the meaning of the passage, and that, content with this slight
reference to a well-known fact, the author passes it by in contemptuous
silence.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note24" id = "eun_note24" href = "#eun_tag24">24.</a>
<i>And in the Thesaurus has described</i>)&mdash;Ver. 10. Cook has the
following appropriate remark upon this passage: “In the ‘Thesaurus,’ or
‘Treasure’ of Luscus Lavinius, a&nbsp;young fellow, having wasted his
estate by his extravagance, sends a servant to search his father’s
monument: but he had before sold the ground on which the monument was,
to a covetous old man; to whom the servant applies to help him open the
monument; in which they discover a hoard and a letter. The old fellow
sees the treasure and keeps it; the young one goes to law with him, and
the old man is represented as opening his cause first before the judge,
which he begins with these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "poem">
<p>‘Athenienses, bellum cum Rhodiensibus,</p>
<p>Quod fuerit, quid ego prædicem?’</p>
</div>

<p>‘Athenians, why should I relate the war with the Rhodians?’ And he
goes on in a manner contrary to the rules of court; which Terence
objects to, because the young man, who was the plaintiff, should open
his cause first. Thus far Bentley, from the same Scholiast [as referred
to in the last Note]. This Note is a clear explanation of the four
verses to which it belongs. Hare concurs with Madame Dacier in her
opinion ‘de Thesauro,’ that it is only a part of the Phasma of Menander,
and not a distinct Play; but were I not determined by the more learned
Bentley, the text itself would not permit me to be of their opinion; for
the words ‘atque in Thesauro scripsit’ seem plainly to me to be a
transition to another Play. The subject of the Thesaurus is related by
Eugraphius, though not with all the circumstances mentioned in my Note
from Bentley.” Colman also remarks here; “Menander and his contemporary
Philemon, each of them wrote a Comedy under this title. We have in the
above Note the story of Menander’s; and we know that of Philemon’s from
the ‘Trinummus’ of Plautus, which was a Translation of it.”</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note25" id = "eun_note25" href = "#eun_tag25">25.</a>
<i>Opportunity of viewing it</i>)&mdash;Ver. 21. Colman thinks that this
means something “stronger than merely being present at the
representation,” and he takes the meaning to be, that having obtained
leave to peruse the MS., he furnished himself with objections against
the piece, which he threw out when it came to be represented before the
magistrates. Cooke thinks that the passage only means, “that he bustled
and took pains to be near enough at the representation to see and hear
plainly.” The truth seems to be that Lavinius managed to obtain
admission at the rehearsal or trial of the merits of the piece before
the magistrates, and that he then behaved himself in the unseemly manner
mentioned in the text.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note26" id = "eun_note26" href = "#eun_tag26">26.</a>
<i>Produced the piece, but still had not deceived him</i>)&mdash;Ver.
24. There is a pun here upon the resemblance in meaning of the words
“verba dare” and “fabulam dare.” The first expression means to “deceive”
or “impose upon;” the latter phrase has also the same meaning, but it
may signify as well “to represent” or “produce a Play.” Thus the
exclamation in its ambiguity may mean, “he has produced a Play, and has
not succeeded in deceiving us,” or “he has deceived us, and yet has not
deceived us.” This is the interpretation which Donatus puts upon the
passage.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note27" id = "eun_note27" href = "#eun_tag27">27.</a>
<i>Colax, an old Play of Plautus</i>)&mdash;Ver. 25. Although Nonius
Marcellus professes to quote from the Colax of Plautus (so called from
the Greek <span class = "greek" title = "Kolàx">Κολὰξ</span>, “a
flatterer” or “parasite”), some scholars have disbelieved in the
existence of any Play of Plautus known by that name. Cooke says: “If
Plautus had wrote a Play under the title of ‘Colax,’ I&nbsp;should think
it very unlikely that it should have escaped Terence’s eye, considering
how soon he flourished after Plautus, his being engaged in the same
studies, and his having such opportunities to consult the libraries of
the great; for though all learning was then confined to Manuscripts,
Terence could have no difficulty in coming at the best copies. The
character of the ‘Miles Gloriosus’ [Braggart Captain] here mentioned,
I&nbsp;am inclined to think the same with that which is the hero of
Plautus’s Comedy, now extant, and called ‘Miles Gloriosus,’ from which
Terence could not take his Thraso. Pyrgopolinices and Thraso are both
full of themselves, both boast of their valor and their intimacy with
princes, and both fancy themselves beloved by all the women who see
them; and they are both played off by their Parasites, but they differ
in their manner and their speech: Plautus’s Pyrgopolinices is always in
the clouds, and talking big, and of blood and wounds&mdash;Terence’s
Thraso never says too little nor much, but is an easy ridiculous
character, continually supplying the Audience with mirth without the
wild extravagant bluster of Pyrgopolinices; Plautus and Terence both
took their soldiers and Parasites from Menander, but gave them different
dresses.” Upon this Note Colman remarks: “Though there is much good
criticism in the above Note, it is certain that Plautus did not take his
‘Miles Gloriosus’ from the Colax of Menander, as he himself informs us
it was translated from a Greek play called <span class = "greek" title =
"Alazôn">Ἀλάζων</span>, ‘the Boaster,’ and the Parasite is but a
trifling character in that play, never appearing after the first
Scene.”</p>

<i>Hurrying servants</i>)&mdash;Ver. 35. On the “currentes servi,” see
the Prologue to the Heautontimorumenos, l. 31. Ovid, in the Amores,
B.&nbsp;i., El. 15, l. 17, 18, mentions a very similar combination of
the characters of Menander’s Comedy: “So long as the deceitful slave,
the harsh father, the roguish procuress, and the cozening courtesan
shall endure, Menander will exist.”</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note29" id = "eun_note29" href = "#eun_tag29">29.</a>
<i>What, then, shall I do?</i>)&mdash;Ver. 46. Phædria, on being sent
for by Thais, breaks out into those words as he enters, after having
deliberated upon his parting with her. Both Horace and Persius have
imitated this passage in their Satires.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note30" id = "eun_note30" href = "#eun_tag30">30.</a>
<i>What! I to her?</i>)&mdash;Ver. 65. Donatus remarks that this is an
abrupt manner of speaking familiarly to persons in anger; and that the
sentences are thus to be understood, “I, go to her? Her, who has
received him! Who has excluded me!”&mdash;inasmuch as indignation loves
to deal in Ellipsis and Aposiopesis.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note31" id = "eun_note31" href = "#eun_tag31">31.</a>
<i>The downfall of our fortunes</i>)&mdash;Ver. 79. Colman observes,
“There is an extreme elegance in this passage in the original; and the
figurative expression is beautifully employed.” “Calamitas” was
originally a word used in husbandry, which signified the destruction of
growing corn; because, as Donatus says, “Comminuit <i>calamum</i> et
segetem;”&mdash;“it strikes down the blades and standing corn.”</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note32" id = "eun_note32" href = "#eun_tag32">32.</a>
<i>Approach this fire</i>)&mdash;Ver. 85. “Ignem” is generally supposed
to be used figuratively here, and to mean “the flame of love.”
Eugraphius, however, would understand the expression literally,
observing that courtesans usually had near their doors an altar sacred
to Venus, on which they daily sacrificed.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note33" id = "eun_note33" href = "#eun_tag33">33.</a>
<i>Of course it’s because</i>)&mdash;Ver. 89. It must be observed that
these words, <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘conmencing’">commencing</ins> with “Sane, quia vero,” in the original,
are said by Phædria not in answer to the words of Thais immediately
preceding, but to her previous question, “Cur non recta introibas?” “Why
didn’t you come into the house at once?” and that they are spoken in
bitter irony.</p>

Promontory of that name in Attica. It was famous for a fair which was
held there. “Sunium’s rocky brow” is mentioned by Byron in the song of
the Greek Captive in the third Canto of Don Juan.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note39" id = "eun_note39" href = "#eun_tag39">39.</a>
<i>Ah wretched me!</i>)&mdash;Ver. 197. Donatus remarks that the Poet
judiciously reserves that part of the plot to be told here, which Thais
did not relate to Phædria in the presence of Parmeno; whom the Poet
keeps in ignorance as to the rank of the damsel, that he may with the
more probability dare to assist Chærea in his attempt on her.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note40" id = "eun_note40" href = "#eun_tag40">40.</a>
<i>From the dispositions of other women</i>)&mdash;Ver. 198. Donatus
observes that this is one of the peculiar points of excellence shown by
Terence, introducing common characters in a new manner, without
departing from custom or nature; since he draws a good Courtesan, and
yet engages the attention of the Spectators and amuses them. Colman has
the following Note here: “Under the name of Thais, Menander is supposed
to have drawn the character of his own mistress, Glycerium, and it seems
he introduced a Courtesan of the same name into several of his Comedies.
One Comedy was entitled ‘Thais,’ from which St. Paul took the sentence
in his Epistle to the Corinthians, ‘Evil communications corrupt good
manners.’” Plutarch has preserved four lines of the Prologue to that
Comedy, in which the Poet, in a kind of mock-heroic manner, invokes the
Muse to teach him to depict the character of his heroine.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note41" id = "eun_note41" href = "#eun_tag41">41.</a>
<i>Not any one was there</i>)&mdash;Ver. 226-7. Very nearly the same
words as these occur in the Mostellaria of Plautus, l. 29, 30: “Than
whom, hitherto, no one of the youth of all Attica has been considered
more temperate or equally frugal.”</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note42" id = "eun_note42" href = "#eun_tag42">42.</a>
<i>Nor submit to blows</i>)&mdash;Ver. 244. It has been remarked in the
Notes to the Translation of Plautus that the Parasites had, in
consequence of their state of dependence, to endure blows and
indignities from their fellow-guests. Their attempts to be “ridiculi” or
“drolls” were made in order to give some small return to their
entertainers. See especially the character of Gelasimus in the Stichus
of Plautus, and the words of Ergasilus in the Captivi, l. 88, 90.
Diderot, as quoted by Colman, observes: “This is the only Scene in
Terence which I remember that can be charged with being superfluous.
Thraso has made a present to Thais of a young girl. Gnatho is to convey
her. Going along with her, he amuses himself with giving the Spectators
a most agreeable eulogium on his profession. But was that the time for
it? Let Gnatho pay due attention on the stage to the young woman whom he
is charged with, and let him say what he will to himself, I&nbsp;consent
to it.”</p>

<i>Cooks</i>)&mdash;Ver. 257. The “coqui” were in the habit of standing
in the market-place for hire by those who required their services. See
the Pseudolus, the Aulularia, and the Mercator of Plautus, and the Notes
to Bohn’s Translation. See also a remark on the knavish character of the
sausage-makers in the Truculentus of Plautus, l.&nbsp;110</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note45" id = "eun_note45" href = "#eun_tag45">45.</a>
<i>Become my follower</i>)&mdash;Ver. 262. “Sectari.” In allusion to the
manners of the ancient Philosophers, who were wont to be followed by a
crowd of their disciples, who were styled “sectatores” and “sectæ.”
Gnatho intends to found a new school of Parasites, who shall be called
the “Gnathonics,” and who, by their artful adulation, shall contrive to
be caressed instead of being maltreated. Artotrogus, the Parasite in the
Miles Gloriosus of Plautus, seems, however, to have forestalled Gnatho
as the founder of this new school.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note46" id = "eun_note46" href = "#eun_tag46">46.</a>
<i>I’m standing</i>)&mdash;Ver. 271. “Quid agitur?” “Statur.” The same
joke occurs in the Pseudolus of Plautus, l. 457. “Quid agitur? Statur
hic ad hunc modum?” “What is going on?” or “What are you about?” “About
standing here in this fashion;” assuming an attitude. Colman observes
that there is much the same kind of conceit in the “Merry Wives of
Windsor.”</p>

</div>

<p>Cooke has the following note: “‘Quid agitur’ is to be supposed to
have a single meaning as spoken by Gnatho, but Parmeno archly renders it
ambiguous by his answer. Our two first English translations, that by
Bernard and that by Hoole, make nothing of it, nor indeed any other part
of their author. Echard follows Madame Dacier, and perceives a joke; but
he does not render ‘quid, agitur’ as the question ought to be
translated. ‘Quid agitur’ sometimes means, ‘What are you doing?’
Sometimes, ‘How do you do?’ ‘How are you?’ or ‘How goes the world with
you?’”</p>

<i>From the Piraeus</i>)&mdash;Ver. 290. The Piraeus was the chief
harbor of Athens, at the mouth of the Cephisus, about three miles from
the City. It was joined to the town by two walls, one of which was built
by Themistocles, and the other by Pericles. It was the duty of the
Athenian youth to watch here in turn by way of precaution against
surprise by pirates or the enemy.</p>

<i>In your little room</i>)&mdash;Ver. 310. Though “cellulam” seems to
be considered by some to mean “cupboard” or “larder,” it is more
probable that it here signifies the little room which was appropriated
to each slave in the family for his own use.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note49" id = "eun_note49" href = "#eun_tag49">49.</a>
<i>Shoulders kept down and chests well girthed</i>)&mdash;Ver. 314.
Ovid, in the Art of Love, B. iii., l. 274, alludes to the “strophium” or
“girth” here referred to: “For high shoulders, small pads are suitable;
and let the girth encircle the bosom that is too prominent.” Becker
thinks that the “strophium” was different from the “fascia” or
“stomacher,” mentioned in the Remedy of Love, l. 338: “Does a swelling
bosom cover all her breast, let no stomacher conceal it.” From Martial
we learn that the “strophium” was made of leather.</p>

you inquire what year she is now passing, nor under what Consulship she
was born; a&nbsp;privilege which the rigid Censor possesses. And this,
especially, if she has passed the bloom of youth, and her best years are

<i>Be my advocate</i>)&mdash;Ver. 340. “Advocatus.” It must be
remembered that this word did not among the Romans bear the same sense
as the word “advocate” does with us. The “advocati” were the friends of
a man who accompanied him when his cause was pleaded, and often
performed the part of witnesses; those who assisted a person in a
dispute or difficulty were also his “advocati,” and in this respect
distantly resembled the “second” or “friend” of a party in the modern
duel. In the Phormio, Hegio, Cratinus, and Crito are introduced as the
“advocati” of Demipho. See also the Pænulus of Plautus, and the Notes to
that Play in Bohn’s Translation.</p>

<i>An hour elapsed</i>)&mdash;Ver. 341. “Hora” is here used to signify
the long time, that, in his impatience, it appeared to him to be.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note56" id = "eun_note56" href = "#eun_tag56">56.</a>
<i>It’s all over with you,&mdash;you’ve said your last</i>)&mdash;Ver.
347. “Ilicet” and “conclamatnm est,” are words of mournful import, which
were used with regard to the funeral rites of the Romans. “Ilicet,” “you
may begone,” was said aloud when the funeral was concluded.
“Conclamare,” implied the ceremony of calling upon the dead person by
name, before light was act to the funeral pile; on no answer being
given, he was concluded to be really dead, and the pile was set fire to
amid the cries of those present: “conclamatum est” would consequently
signify that all hope has gone.</p>

<i>Thais the Courtesan</i>)&mdash;Ver. 352. Cooke remarks here, somewhat
hypercritically as it would seem: “Thais is not called ‘meretrix’ here
opprobriously, but to distinguish her from other ladies of the same
name, who were not of the same profession.”</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note58" id = "eun_note58" href = "#eun_tag58">58.</a>
<i>A Eunuch</i>)&mdash;Ver. 356. Eunuchs formed part of the
establishment of wealthy persons, who, in imitation of the Eastern
nobles, confided the charge of their wives, daughters, or mistresses to
them. Though Thais would have no such necessity for his services, her
wish to imitate the “reginæ,” or “great ladies,” would make him a not
unacceptable present. See the Addresses of Ovid to the Eunuch Bagoüs in
the Amours, B. ii., El. 2,&nbsp;3.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note59" id = "eun_note59" href = "#eun_tag59">59.</a>
<i>as she is reported to be</i>)&mdash;Ver. 361. Donatus remarks this as
an instance of the art of Terence, in preserving the probability of
Chærea’s being received for the Eunuch. He shows hereby that he is so
entirely a stranger to the family that he does not even know the person
of Thais. It is also added that she has not been long in the
neighborhood, and he has been on duty at the Piraeus. The meaning of his
regret is, that, not knowing Thais, he will not have an opportunity of
seeing the girl.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note60" id = "eun_note60" href = "#eun_tag60">60.</a>
<i>Have to pay the penalty</i>)&mdash;Ver. 381. “In me cadetur faba,”
literally, “the bean will be struck” or “laid about me;” meaning, “I
shall have to smart for it.” There is considerable doubt what is the
origin of this expression, and this doubt existed as early as the time
of Donatus. He says that it was a proverb either taken from the
threshing of beans with a flail by the countrymen; or else from the
circumstance of the cooks who have dressed the beans, but have not
moistened them sufficiently, being sure to have them thrown at their
heads, as though for the purpose of softening them. Neither of these
solutions seems so probable as that suggested by Madame Dacier, that
dried beans were inserted in the thongs of the “scuticæ,” or “whips,”
with which the slaves were beaten. According to others the knots in the
whips were only called “fabæ,” from their resemblance to beans.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note61" id = "eun_note61" href = "#eun_tag61">61.</a>
<i>Is it disgraceful</i>)&mdash;Ver. 382. Donatus remarks that here
Terence obliquely defends the subject of the Play.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note62" id = "eun_note62" href = "#eun_tag62">62.</a>
<i>The most mighty King</i>)&mdash;Ver. 397. It has been suggested that
Darius III. is here alluded to, who was a contemporary of Menander. As
however Pyrrhus, king of Epirus, is mentioned in this Play, there is no
necessity to go out of the way to make Terence guilty of an anachronism.
Madame Dacier suggests that Seleucus, king of part of Asia Minor, is
meant; and as Thraso is called “a stranger” or “foreigner” toward the
end of the Play, he probably was intended to be represented as a native
of Asia and a subject of Seleucus. One of the Seleuci was also favored
with the services of Pyrgopolinices, the “Braggart Captain” of Plantus,
in the Miles Gloriosus. See l. 75 in that Play: “For King Seleucus
entreated me with most earnest suit that I would raise and enlist
recruits for him.”</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note63" id = "eun_note63" href = "#eun_tag63">63.</a>
<i>You’ve just hit it</i>)&mdash;Ver. 401. Colman here remarks, quoting
the following passage from Shakspeare’s “Love’s Labor Lost,” “That that
Poet was familiarly acquainted with this Comedy is evident from the
passage, ‘Holofernes says, <i>Novi hominem tanquam te</i>. His humor is
lofty, his discourse peremptory, his tongue filed, his eye ambitious,
his gait majestical, and his general behavior vain, ridiculous, and
Thrasonical.’” We may remark that the previous words of Gnatho, though
spoken with reference to the King, contain a reproach against the
Captain’s boastfulness, though his vanity will not let him perceive
it.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note64" id = "eun_note64" href = "#eun_tag64">64.</a>
<i>In his eye</i>)&mdash;Ver. 401. “In oculis” is generally supposed to
mean “as dearly in his eyes.” As, however, the Satraps of the East were
called “the king’s eyes,” those who suppose that Darius is alluded to,
might with some ground consider the passage as meaning that the king
ranked him in the number of his nobles. See the Pænulus of Plautus,
l.&nbsp;693, and the Note in Bohn’s Translation.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note65" id = "eun_note65" href = "#eun_tag65">65.</a>
<i>You understand</i>)&mdash;Ver. 405. He says this at the very moment
when he is at a loss what to say next; the Parasite obligingly steps in
to help him out with the difficulty.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note66" id = "eun_note66" href = "#eun_tag66">66.</a>
<i>Indeed, of none</i>)&mdash;Ver. 410. “Immo, nullorum arbitror, si
tecum vivit.” This expression which is used “aside,” has two meanings,
neither of which is complimentary to the Captain. It may mean, “he has
no society if he associates with you,” making the Captain equivalent to
nobody; or it may signify, “if he associates with you he’ll be sure to
drive all his other acquaintances away.”</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note67" id = "eun_note67" href = "#eun_tag67">67.</a>
<i>Over the Indian elephants</i>)&mdash;Ver. 413. Here he shows his
lofty position to perfection; he dares to take down the pride of one who
commanded even the royal elephants. The Braggart Captain of Plautus
comes into collision with the elephants themselves: l. 26. Artotrogus
says to him, “In what a fashion it was you broke the fore-leg of even an
elephant in India with your fist!”</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note68" id = "eun_note68" href = "#eun_tag68">68.</a>
<i>Looking out for game?</i>)&mdash;Ver. 426. “Pulmentum,” more strictly
speaking, “A nice bit.” Patrick has the following Note on this passage:
“‘Lepus tute es, et pulmentum quæris?’ A&nbsp;proverbial expression in
use at that time: the proper meaning of it, stripped of its figure, is,
‘You are little more than a woman yourself, and do you want a
mistress?’” We learn from Donatus and Vopiscus, that Livius Andronicus
had used this proverb in his Plays before Terence. Commentators who
enter into a minute explanation of it offer many conjectures rather
curious than solid, and of a nature not fit to be mentioned here.
Donatus seems to think that allusion is made to a story prevalent among
the ancient naturalists that the hare was in the habit of changing its
sex.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note69" id = "eun_note69" href = "#eun_tag69">69.</a>
<i>If, indeed, she loved me</i>)&mdash;Ver. 446. Colman has the
following Note upon this passage: “I&nbsp;am at a loss to determine
whether it was in order to show the absurdity of the Captain or from
inadvertence in the Poet, that Terence here makes Thraso and Gnatho
speak in contradiction to the idea of Thais’s wonderful veneration for
Thraso, with which they opened the Scene.”</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note70" id = "eun_note70" href = "#eun_tag70">70.</a>
<i>In exercises</i>)&mdash;Ver. 477. Reference will be found made to the
“palæstræ,” or “places of exercise,” in the Notes to the Translation of
Plautus.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note71" id = "eun_note71" href = "#eun_tag71">71.</a>
<i>If occasion served</i>)&mdash;Ver. 479. The Aposiopesis in this line
is very aptly introduced, on account of the presence of the female; but
it admirably illustrates the abominable turpitude of the speaker, and
perhaps in a somewhat more decent manner than that in which Plautus
attributes a similar tendency to his Braggart Captain, l.&nbsp;1111.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note72" id = "eun_note72" href = "#eun_tag72">72.</a>
<i>Out of the very flames</i>)&mdash;Ver. 491. This was a proverb
expressive of the lowest degree of meanness and infamy. When they burned
the bodies of the dead, it was the custom of the ancients to throw meat
and various articles of food upon the funeral pile, and it was
considered the greatest possible affront to tell a person that he was
capable of snatching these things out of the flames.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note73" id = "eun_note73" href = "#eun_tag73">73.</a>
<i>If Chremes should happen to come</i>)&mdash;Ver. 513. This is the
first allusion to the arrangement which ultimately causes the quarrel
between Thais and the Captain.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note74" id = "eun_note74" href = "#eun_tag74">74.</a>
<i>Had been offering a sacrifice</i>)&mdash;Ver. 513. It was the custom
to sacrifice before entering on affairs of importance. Thus, too,
Jupiter, in the Amphitryon of Plautus, l. 938, speaks of offering
sacrifice on his safe return.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note75" id = "eun_note75" href = "#eun_tag75">75.</a>
<i>Our rings were given</i>)&mdash;Ver. 541. It was the custom of
parties who agreed to join in a “symbola,” or “club” or “picnic”
entertainment, to give their rings as pledges to the “rex convivii,” or
“getter up the feast.” Stakes were also deposited on making bets at
races. See Ovid’s Art of Love, B. i., l. 168.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note76" id = "eun_note76" href = "#eun_tag76">76.</a>
<i>To meet my death</i>)&mdash;Ver. 550. There is a passage in the
Othello of Shakspeare extremely similar to this:</p>

<div class = "poem">
<p>&mdash;&mdash;“If I were now to die,</p>
<p>I were now to be most happy; for, I fear,</p>
<p>My soul hath her content so absolute,</p>
<p>That not another comfort, like to this,</p>
<p>Succeeds in unknown fate.”</p>
</div>

<p><a name = "eun_note77" id = "eun_note77" href = "#eun_tag77">77.</a>
<i>In the inner apartments</i>)&mdash;Ver. 579. The “Gynecæa,” or
women’s apartments, among the Greeks, always occupied the interior part
of the house, which was most distant from the street, and there they
were kept in great seclusion.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note78" id = "eun_note78" href = "#eun_tag78">78.</a>
<i>A few novices of girls</i>)&mdash;Ver. 582. These “noviciæ” were
young slaves recently bought, and intended to be trained to the calling
of a Courtesan.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note79" id = "eun_note79" href = "#eun_tag79">79.</a>
<i>At a certain painting</i>)&mdash;Ver. 584. See the story of Jupiter
and Danaë, the daughter of Acrisius, king of Argos, in the Metamorphoses
of Ovid, B.&nbsp;iv., l.&nbsp;610. Pictures of Venus and Adonis, and of
Jupiter and Ganymede, are mentioned in the Menæchmi of Plautus;
l.&nbsp;144, and paintings on the walls are also mentioned in the
Mostellaria of Plantus, l.&nbsp;821, where Tranio tries to impose upon
Theuropides by pretending to point out a picture of a crow between two
vultures.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note80" id = "eun_note80" href = "#eun_tag80">80.</a>
<i>How Jove</i>)&mdash;Ver. 584. Donatus remarks here that this was “a
very proper piece of furniture for the house of a Courtesan, giving an
example of loose and mercenary love, calculated to excite wanton
thoughts, and at the same time hinting to the young lover that he must
make his way to the bosom of his mistress, like Jupiter to Danaë, in a
shower of gold. Oh the avarice of harlots!”</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note81" id = "eun_note81" href = "#eun_tag81">81.</a>
<i>A poor creature of a mortal</i>)&mdash;Ver. 591. “Homuncio.” He uses
this word the better to contrast his abject nature as a poor mortal with
the majesty of Jupiter. St. Augustin refers to this passage. The
preceding line is said by Donatus to be a parody on a passage by
Ennius.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note82" id = "eun_note82" href = "#eun_tag82">82.</a>
<i>Take this fan</i>)&mdash;Ver. 595. As to the fans of the ancients,
see the Trinummus of Plautus, l. 252, and the Note to the passage in
Bohn’s Translation. See also the Amours of Ovid, B. iii., El. 2, l.
38.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note83" id = "eun_note83" href = "#eun_tag83">83.</a>
<i>Chattered aloud</i>)&mdash;Ver. 600. This line bears a strong
resemblance to two lines found in Anstey’s new Bath Guide:</p>

<div class = "poem">
<p>“And how the young ladies all set up their clacks,</p>
<p>All the while an old woman was rubbing their backs.”</p>
</div>

<p><a name = "eun_note84" id = "eun_note84" href = "#eun_tag84">84.</a>
<i>I slily looked askance</i>)&mdash;Ver. 601. This way of looking
aside, “limis,” is mentioned in the Miles Gloriosus of Plautus, where
Milphidippa tells Acroteleutium to look at the Captain sideways,
“Aspicito limis,” l. 1217; also in the Bacchides, l. 1131. Those
familiar with the works of Hogarth will readily call to mind the picture
of Bedlam in the Rake’s Progress, whore the young woman is looking
askance through her fan at the madman in his cell.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note85" id = "eun_note85" href = "#eun_tag85">85.</a>
<i>Through the fan</i>)&mdash;Ver. 602. This shows that the fan was
probably one made of thin boards, and not of feathers.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note86" id = "eun_note86" href = "#eun_tag86">86.</a>
<i>So short-lived</i>)&mdash;Ver. 605. Colman has the following Note
here: “Short indeed, considering the number of incidents, which,
according to Chærea’s relation, are crowded into it. All the time
allowed for this adventure is the short space between the departure of
Thais and Thraso and the entrance of Chærea; so that all this variety of
business of sleeping, bathing, ravishing, &amp;c., is dispatched during
the two soliloquies of Antipho and Chærea, and the short Scene between
Chremes and Pythias. The truth is, that a very close adherence to the
unities often drives the Poet into as great absurdities as the perfect
violation of them.”</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note87" id = "eun_note87" href = "#eun_tag87">87.</a>
<i>Took off her golden jewels</i>)&mdash;Ver. 627. This was probably
because it was contrary to the laws of Athens for a Courtesan to appear
with gold or jewels in the street. Madame Dacier suggests another
reason, in which there is some force, although it is ridiculed by Cooke.
Thais may have supposed that the Captain, when irritated, might not have
scrupled to take them away from her. Indeed, nothing would be more
probable, than that he would be ready to take them by way of security
for the return of the slave, whom he had thus, to no purpose, presented
to her. In reference to the preceding line, we may remark that it was
not customary among the Greeks for females of good character to appear
at table with strangers.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note88" id = "eun_note88" href = "#eun_tag88">88.</a>
<i>While I was going</i>)&mdash;Ver. 629. Donatus remarks that here the
Poet artfully finds a reason to bring Phædria back again; as he at first
with equal art sent him out of the way, to give probability to those
incidents necessary to happen in his absence.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note89" id = "eun_note89" href = "#eun_tag89">89.</a>
<i>At a distance</i>)&mdash;Ver. 640. “Extremâ lineâ.” There have been
many suggestions offered for the origin of this figurative expression.
Some suggest that it alludes to the last or lowest stage of the supposed
ladder of love; others that it refers to the first or elementary line
traced by the student, when beginning to learn the art of painting. It
is however more generally thought to be a metaphor taken from the
chariot-races in the Circus, where, in going round the turning-place, he
who was nearest was said “currere in primâ lineâ;” the next, “in
secundâ;” and so on to the last, who took the widest range, and was said
to run “in extremâ lineâ.”</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note90" id = "eun_note90" href = "#eun_tag90">90.</a>
<i>In party-colored clothes</i>)&mdash;Ver. 683. It was the custom to
dress Eunuchs in party-colored clothes of bright hue. Most probably it
was from them that the “motley” descended to the fools and buffoons of
the Middle Ages.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note91" id = "eun_note91" href = "#eun_tag91">91.</a>
<i>With a speckled complexion</i>)&mdash;Ver. 689. “Colore stellionino;”
probably having spots or freckles on his face like a “stellio” or
“lizard.”</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note92" id = "eun_note92" href = "#eun_tag92">92.</a>
<i>Have done a service to her</i>)&mdash;Ver. 722. Though some would
have “illi” here to refer to the damsel, and others again to Phædria, it
is pretty clear that Madame Dacier is right in suggesting that Thais is
the person meant.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note93" id = "eun_note93" href = "#eun_tag93">93.</a>
<i>Casket with the tokens</i>)&mdash;Ver. 752. It was the custom with
the ancients when they exposed their children, to leave with them some
pledge or token of value, that they might afterward be recognized by
means of them. The catastrophes of the Curculio, the Rudens, and other
Plays of Plautus, are brought about by taking advantage of this
circumstance. The reasons for using these tokens will be stated in a
future Note.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note94" id = "eun_note94" href = "#eun_tag94">94.</a>
<i>Is a foreigner</i>)&mdash;Ver. 758. And therefore the more unlikely
to obtain redress from an Athenian tribunal. See the Andria, <a href =
"#and_tag88">l.&nbsp;811</a>, and the Note to the passage.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note95" id = "eun_note95" href = "#eun_tag95">95.</a>
<i>And his maniple</i>)&mdash;Ver. 775. We learn from the Fasti of Ovid,
B. iii., l.&nbsp;117-8, that in early times the Roman armies carried
bundles or wisps of hay upon poles by way of standards. “A long pole
used to bear the elevated wisps, from which circumstance the manipular
soldier derives his name.” It appears from this passage, and from other
authors, that to every troop of one hundred men a “manipulus” or wisp of
hay (so called from “manum implere,” to “fill the hand,” as being “a
handful”), was assigned as a standard, and hence in time the company
itself obtained the name of “manipulus,” and the soldier, a&nbsp;member
of it, was called “manipularis.” The “centurio,” or “leader of a
hundred,” was the commanding officer of the “manipulus.”</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note96" id = "eun_note96" href = "#eun_tag96">96.</a>
<i>With a dish-clout</i>)&mdash;Ver. 776. “Peniculo.” This word meant a
sponge fastened to a stick, or the tail of a fox or an ox, which was
used as dusters or dish-clouts are at the present day for cleaning
tables, dishes, or even shoes. See the Menæchmi of Plautus, ver. 77 and
391.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note97" id = "eun_note97" href = "#eun_tag97">97.</a>
<i>Be behind the second rank</i>)&mdash;Ver. 780. “Post principia.” The
Captain, with that discretion which is the better part of valor, chooses
the safest place in his army. The “principes” originally fought in the
van, fronting the enemy, and behind them were the “hastati” and the
“triarii.” In later times the “hastati” faced the enemy, and the
“principes” were placed in the middle, between them and the “triarii;”
but though no longer occupying the front place, they still retained the
name. Thraso, then, places himself behind the middle line.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note98" id = "eun_note98" href = "#eun_tag98">98.</a>
<i>Pyrrhus used to proceed</i>)&mdash;Ver. 782. He attempts to defend
his cowardice by the example of Pyrrhus, the powerful antagonist of the
Romans, and one of the greatest generals of antiquity. He might have
more correctly cited the example of Xerxes, who, according to Justin,
did occupy that position in his army.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note99" id = "eun_note99" href = "#eun_tag99">99.</a>
<i>I could very much</i>)&mdash;Ver. 785. Although Vollbehr gives these
words to Gnatho, yet, judging from the context, and the words “ex
occulto,” and remembering that Thais and Chremes are up at the window,
there is the greatest probability that these are really the words of
Thais addressed aside to Chremes.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note100" id = "eun_note100" href =
"#eun_tag100">100.</a>
<i>You gallows-bird</i>)&mdash;Ver. 797. “Furcifer;” literally, “bearer
of the furca.”</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note101" id = "eun_note101" href =
"#eun_tag101">101.</a>
<i>As befits gallant soldiers</i>)&mdash;Ver. 814. Beaumont and Fletcher
not improbably had this scene in view in their picture of the mob
regiment in Philaster. The ragged regiment which Shakspeare places under
the command of Falstaff was not very unlike it, nor that which owned the
valiant Bombastes Furioso as its Captain.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note102" id = "eun_note102" href =
"#eun_tag102">102.</a>
<i>At Antipho’s</i>)&mdash;Ver. 839. Madame Dacier here observes that
Chærea assigns very natural reasons for not having changed his dress; in
which the art of Terence is evident, since the sequel of the Play makes
it absolutely necessary that Chærea should appear again before Thais in
the habit which he wore while in the house.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note103" id = "eun_note103" href =
"#eun_tag103">103.</a>
<i>Pick daintily about</i>)&mdash;Ver. 935. He seems here to reprehend
the same practice against which Ovid warns his fair readers, in his Art
of Love, B. iii. l. 75. He says, “Do not first take food at home,” when
about to go to an entertainment. Westerhovius seems to think that
“ligurio” means, not to “pick daintily,” but “to be fond of good
eating;” and refers to the Bacchides of Plautus as portraying courtesans
of the “ligurient” kind, and finds another specimen in Bacchis in the
Heautontimorumenos.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note104" id = "eun_note104" href =
"#eun_tag104">104.</a>
<i>This advantage</i>)&mdash;Ver. 970. Donatus here observes that the
Poet introduces Laches, as he has Parmeno just before, in a state of
perfect tranquillity, that their sudden change of feeling may be the
more diverting to the Audience.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note105" id = "eun_note105" href =
"#eun_tag105">105.</a>
<i>For some occasion</i>)&mdash;Ver. 999. We learn from Donatus that
Menander was more explicit concerning the resentment of Laches against
Thais, on account of her having corrupted Phædria.</p>

<p><a name = "eun_note106" id = "eun_note106" href =
"#eun_tag106">106.</a>
<i>As I knew</i>)&mdash;Ver. 1003. She enjoyed it the more, knowing that
the old man had nothing to fear, as he had just heard the fiction which
she had imparted to Parmeno. Donatus observes that the terror of Laches
accounts for his sudden consent to the union of Chærea with Pamphila;
for though he could not settle the matter any other way with credit, he
was glad to find that his son had made an unequal match rather than
endangered his life. Colman, however, observes with considerable
justice: “I think Chærea apologizes still better for this arrangement in
the Scene with Thais at the opening of this Act, where he says that he
is confident of obtaining his father’s consent, provided Pamphila proves
to be a citizen; and, indeed, the match between them is rather a
reparation of an injury done to her than a degradation of himself.”</p>

present she means Chærea in the disguise of the Eunuch.</p>

<i>Hercules served Omphale</i>)&mdash;Ver. 1026. He alludes to the story
of Omphale, Queen of Lydia, and Hercules. Being violently in love with
her, the hero laid aside his club and boar’s skin, and in the habit of a
woman plied the spindle and distaff with her maids. See a curious story
of Omphale, Hercules, and Faunus, in the Fasti of Ovid, B. ii. l. 305.
As to the reappearance of Thraso here, Colman has the following remarks:
“Thraso, says Donatus, is brought back again in order to be admitted to
some share in the good graces of Thais, that he may not be made unhappy
at the end of the Play; but surely it is an essential part of the
poetical justice of Comedy to expose coxcombs to ridicule and to punish
them, though without any shocking severity, for their follies.”</p>

<i>With a slipper</i>)&mdash;Ver. 1027. He doubtless alludes to the
treatment of Hercules by Omphale; and, according to Lucian, there was a
story that Omphale used to beat him with her slipper or sandal. On that
article of dress, see the Notes to the Trinummus of Plautus, l. 252.</p>

<i>To the patronage of my father</i>)&mdash;Ver. 1038. It was the custom
at Athens for strangers, such as Thais was, to put themselves under the
protection (in clientelam) of some wealthy citizen, who, as their
patron, was bound to protect them against injury. An exactly parallel
case to the present is found in the Miles Gloriosus of Plautus, l. 799,
where the wealthy Periplecomenus says, “Habeo, eccillam, meam clientam,
meretricem adolescentulam.” “Why, look, I&nbsp;have one,
a&nbsp;dependent of mine, a&nbsp;courtesan, a&nbsp;very young
woman.”</p>

<i>Been rolling that stone</i>)&mdash;Ver. 1084. Donatus thinks that he
alludes to the story of Sisyphus, who, in the Infernal Regions, was
condemned eternally to roll a stone up a hill, which, on arriving at the
summit, immediately fell to the bottom.</p>

<i>Make him over to you</i>)&mdash;Ver. 1086. “Vobis propino.” The word
“propino” was properly applied to the act of tasting a cup of wine, and
then handing it to another; he means that he has had his taste of the
Captain, and is now ready to hand him over to them.</p>

<i>He quite deserves it</i>)&mdash;Ver. 1087. Cooke has the following
appropriate remark: “I can not think that this Play, excellent as it is
in almost all other respects, concludes consistently with the manners of
gentlemen; there is a meanness in Phædria and Chærea consenting to take
Thraso into their society, with a view of fleecing him, which the Poet
should have avoided.”</p>
