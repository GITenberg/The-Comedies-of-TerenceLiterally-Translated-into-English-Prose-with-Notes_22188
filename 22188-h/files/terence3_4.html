THE SUBJECT.</a></h3>

<hr class = "small">

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Chremes</span> commands his wife, when
pregnant, if she is delivered of a girl immediately to kill the child.
Having given birth to a girl, Sostrata delivers her to an old woman
named Philtera to be exposed. Instead of doing this, Philtera calls her
Antiphila, and brings her up as her own. Clinia, the son of Menedemus,
falls in love with her, and treats her as though his wife. Menedemus, on
learning this, is very angry, and by his harsh language drives away his
son from home. Taking this to heart, and in order to punish himself for
his ill-timed severity, Menedemus, though now an aged man, fatigues
himself by laboring at agricultural pursuits from morning till night. At
the period when the Play commences, Clinia has just returned to Attica,
but not daring to go to his father’s house, is entertained by Clitipho,
the son of Chremes, who is the neighbor of Menedemus. Clitipho then
sends for Antiphila, whose supposed mother has recently died, to come
and meet her lover. On the same day, Chremes learns from Menedemus how
anxious he is for his son’s return; and on hearing from his son of the
arrival of Clinia, he defers informing Menedemus of it until the next
day. Syrus, the servant who has been sent to fetch Antiphila, also
brings with him Bacchis, an extravagant Courtesan, the mistress of
Clitipho. To conceal the truth from Chremes, they represent to him that
Bacchis is the mistress of Clinia, and that Antiphila is one of her
maids. Next morning Chremes informs Menedemus of his son’s arrival, and
of the extravagant conduct of his mistress, but begs that he will
conceal from Clinia his knowledge of this fact. Bacchis requiring ten
minæ, Syrus devises a plan for obtaining the money from Chremes, while
the latter is encouraging him to think of a project against Menedemus.
Syrus tells him a story, that the mother of Antiphila had borrowed a
thousand drachmæ of Bacchis, and being dead, the girl is left in her
hands as a pledge for the money. While these things are going on,
Sostrata discovers in Antiphila her own daughter. In order to obtain the
money which Bacchis persists in demanding, Syrus suggests to Chremes
that it should be represented to Menedemus that Bacchis is the mistress
of Clitipho, and that he should be requested to conceal her in his house
for a few days; it is also arranged that Clinia shall pretend to his
father to be in love with Antiphila, and to beg her as his wife. He is
then to ask for money, as though for the wedding, which is to be handed
over to Bacchis. Chremes does not at first approve of the plan suggested
by Syrus; but he pays down the money for which he has been informed his
daughter is a pledge in the hands of Bacchis. This, with his knowledge,
is given to Clitipho, who, as Syrus says, is to convey it to Bacchis,
who is now in the house of Menedemus, to make the latter more readily
believe that she is his mistress. Shortly after this, the plot is
discovered by Chremes, who threatens to punish Clitipho and Syrus. The
Play concludes with Chremes giving his consent to the marriage of Clinia
with Antiphila, and pardoning Clitipho, who promises to abandon the
Courtesan, and marry. Unlike the other Plays of Terence and Plautus, the
Plot of this Play extends over two days.</p>

<h5>THE SUMMARY OF C. SULPITIUS APOLLINARIS.</h5>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">A severe</span> father compels his son
Clinia, in love with Antiphila, to go abroad to the wars; and repenting
of what has been done, torments himself in mind. Afterward, when he has
returned, unknown to his father, he is entertained at the house of
Clitipho. The latter is in love with Bacchis, a&nbsp;Courtesan. When
Clinia sends for his much-loved Antiphila, Bacchis comes, as though his
mistress, and Antiphila, wearing the garb of her servant; this is done
in order that Clitipho may conceal it from his father. He, through the
stratagems of Syrus, gets ten minæ from the old man for the Courtesan.
Antiphila is discovered to be the sister of Clitipho. Clinia receives
her, <i>and</i> Clitipho, another woman, for his wife.</p>

THE PROLOGUE.</a></h4>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Lest</span> it should be a matter of
surprise to any one of you, why the Poet has assigned to an old man<a
class = "tag" name = "torm_tag12" id = "torm_tag12" href =
"#torm_note12">12</a> a&nbsp;part that belongs to the young, that I will
first explain to you;<a class = "tag" name = "torm_tag13" id =
"torm_tag13" href = "#torm_note13">13</a> and then, the reason
<span class = "pagenum">136</span>
for my coming I will disclose. An entire Play from an entire Greek
one,<a class = "tag" name = "torm_tag14" id = "torm_tag14" href =
"#torm_note14">14</a> the Heautontimorumenos, I&nbsp;am to-day about to
represent, which from a two-fold plot<a class = "tag" name =
"torm_tag15" id = "torm_tag15" href = "#torm_note15">15</a> has been
made but one. I&nbsp;have shown that it is new, and what it is: next I
would mention who it was that wrote it, and whose in Greek it is, if I
did not think that the greater part of you are aware. Now, for what
reason I have learned this part, in a few words I will explain. <i>The
Poet</i> intended me to be a Pleader,<a class = "tag" name =
"torm_tag16" id = "torm_tag16" href = "#torm_note16">16</a> not the
Speaker of a Prologue; your decision he asks, <i>and</i> has appointed
me the advocate; if this advocate can avail as much by his oral powers
as he has excelled in inventing happily, who composed this speech which
I am about to recite. For as to malevolent rumors spreading abroad that
he has mixed together many Greek Plays while writing a few Latin ones,
he does not deny that this is the case, and that he does not repent
<i>of so doing</i>; and he affirms that he will do so again. He has the
example of good <i>Poets</i>; after which example he thinks it is
allowable for him to do what
<span class = "pagenum">137</span>
they have done. Then, as to a malevolent old Poet<a class = "tag" name =
"torm_tag17" id = "torm_tag17" href = "#torm_note17">17</a> saying that
he has suddenly applied himself to dramatic pursuits, relying on the
genius of his friends,<a class = "tag" name = "torm_tag18" id =
"torm_tag18" href = "#torm_note18">18</a> <i>and</i> not his own natural
abilities; <i>on that</i> your judgment, your opinion, will prevail.
Wherefore I do entreat you all, that the suggestions of our antagonists
may not avail more than <i>those</i> of our favorers. Do you be
favorable; grant the means of prospering to those who afford you the
means of being spectators of new Plays; <i>those, I&nbsp;mean</i>,
without faults: that he may not suppose this said in his behalf who
lately made the public give way to a slave as he ran along in the
street;<a class = "tag" name = "torm_tag19" id = "torm_tag19" href =
"#torm_note19">19</a> why should he take a madman’s part? About his
faults he will say more when he brings out some other new ones, unless
he puts an end to his caviling. Attend with favorable feelings; grant me
the opportunity that I may be allowed to act a quiet Play<a class =
"tag" name = "torm_tag20" id = "torm_tag20" href = "#torm_note20">20</a>
in
<span class = "pagenum">138</span>
silence; that the servant everlastingly running about, the angry old
man, the gluttonous parasite, the impudent sharper, <i>and</i> the
greedy procurer, may not have always to be performed by me with the
utmost expense of voice, <i>and</i> the greatest exertion. For my sake
come to the conclusion that this request is fair, that so some portion
of my labor may be abridged. For nowadays, those who write new
<i>Plays</i> do not spare an aged man. If there is any <i>piece</i>
requiring exertion, they come running to me; but if it is a light one,
it is taken to another Company. In the present one the style is pure. Do
you make proof, what, in each character,<a class = "tag" name =
"torm_tag21" id = "torm_tag21" href = "#torm_note21">21</a> my ability
can effect. If I have never greedily set a <i>high</i> price upon my
skill, and have come to the conclusion that this is my greatest gain, as
far as possible to be subservient to your convenience, establish in me a
precedent, that the young may be anxious rather to please you than
themselves.</p>

require. For, in the name of Gods and men, what would you have? What can

now, or not, is uncertain.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Chrem.</span> Why so?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Men.</span> You shall know:&mdash;There is a
poor old woman here, a&nbsp;stranger from Corinth:&mdash;her daughter,
a&nbsp;young woman, he fell in love with, insomuch that he almost
regarded her as his wife; all this <i>took place</i> unknown to me. When
I
<span class = "pagenum">141</span>
discovered the matter, I&nbsp;began to reprove him, not with gentleness,
nor in the way suited to the love-sick mind of a youth, but with
violence, and after the usual method of fathers. I&nbsp;was daily
reproaching him,&mdash;“Look you, do you expect to be allowed any longer
to act thus, myself, your father, being alive; to be keeping a mistress
pretty much as though your wife? You are mistaken, Clinia, and you don’t
know me, if you fancy that. I&nbsp;am willing that you should be called
my <i>son</i>, just as long as you do what becomes you; but if you do
not do so, I&nbsp;shall find out how it becomes me to act toward you.
This arises from nothing, in fact, but too much idleness. At your time
of life, I&nbsp;did not devote my time to dalliance, but, in consequence
of my poverty, departed hence for Asia, and there acquired in arms both
riches and military glory.” At length the matter came to this,&mdash;the
youth, from hearing the same things so often, and with such severity,
was overcome. He supposed that I, through age and affection, had more
judgment and foresight for him than himself. He went off to Asia,
Chremes, to serve under the king.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Chrem.</span> What is it you say?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Men.</span> He departed without my
knowledge&mdash;<i>and</i> has been gone these three months.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Chrem.</span> Both are to be
blamed&mdash;although <i>I</i> still <i>think</i> this step shows an
ingenuous and enterprising disposition.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Men.</span> When I learned <i>this</i> from
those who were in the secret, I&nbsp;returned home sad, and with
feelings almost overwhelmed and distracted through grief. I&nbsp;sit
down; my servants run to me; they take off my shoes:<a class = "tag"
name = "torm_tag24" id = "torm_tag24" href = "#torm_note24">24</a> then
some make all haste to spread the couches,<a class = "tag" name =
"torm_tag25" id = "torm_tag25" href = "#torm_note25">25</a> and to
prepare a repast; each according to his ability did zealously <i>what he
could</i>, in order to alleviate my sorrow. When I observed this,
I&nbsp;began to reflect thus:&mdash;“What! are so many persons anxious
for my sake alone, to pleasure myself only? Are so
<span class = "pagenum">142</span>
many female servants to provide me with dress?<a class = "tag" name =
"torm_tag26" id = "torm_tag26" href = "#torm_note26">26</a> Shall I
alone keep up such an expensive establishment, while my only son, who
ought equally, or even more so, to enjoy these things&mdash;inasmuch as
his age is better suited for the enjoyment of them&mdash;him, poor
<i>youth</i>, have I driven away from home by my severity! Were I to do
this, really I should deem myself deserving of any calamity. But so long
as he leads this life of penury, banished from his country through my
severity, I&nbsp;will revenge his wrongs upon myself, toiling, making
money, saving, and laying up for him.” At once I set about it;
I&nbsp;left nothing in the house, neither movables<a class = "tag" name
= "torm_tag27" id = "torm_tag27" href = "#torm_note27">27</a> nor
clothing; every thing I scraped together. Slaves, male and female,
except those who could easily pay for their keep by working in the
country, all of them I set up to auction and sold. I&nbsp;at once put up
a bill to sell my house.<a class = "tag" name = "torm_tag28" id =
"torm_tag28" href = "#torm_note28">28</a> I&nbsp;collected somewhere
about fifteen talents, and purchased this farm; here I fatigue myself.
I&nbsp;have come to this conclusion, Chremes, that I do my son a less
injury, while I am unhappy; and that it is not right for me to enjoy any
pleasure here, until such time as he returns home safe to share
<i>it</i> with me.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Chrem.</span> I believe you to be of an

did you understand him sufficiently well, nor he you&mdash;a thing that
happens where persons don’t live on terms of frankness together. You
never showed him how highly you valued him, nor did he <i>ever</i> dare

There was no occasion for me to remind him: they tell me he has been

I’ll go in-doors immediately. But what means the noise at the door of my

<p><span class = "charname">Chrem.</span> I have heard that he has; in

<p><span class = "charname">Chrem.</span> What is it you say?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Clit.</span> Upon his arrival, after he had

<p><span class = "charname">Clit.</span> Take care what you do; there is
no necessity, father, <i>for doing so</i>.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Chrem.</span> For what reason?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Clit.</span> Why, because he is as yet
undetermined what to do with himself. He is but just arrived. He fears
every thing; his father’s displeasure, and how his mistress may be
disposed toward him. He loves her to distraction: on her account, this
trouble and going abroad took place.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Chrem.</span> I know it.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Clit.</span> He has just sent a servant into

say?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Clit.</span> What <i>does</i> he <i>say</i>?
That he is wretched.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Chrem.</span> Wretched? Whom could we less
suppose so? What is there wanting for him to enjoy every thing that
among men, in fact, are esteemed as blessings? Parents, a&nbsp;country
in prosperity, friends, family, relations, riches? And yet, <i>all</i>
these are just according to the disposition of him who possesses them.
To him who knows how to use them, they are blessings; to him who does
not use them rightly, <i>they are</i> evils.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">146</span>
<p><span class = "charname">Clit.</span> Aye, but he always was a morose
old man; and now I dread nothing more, father, than that in his
displeasure he’ll be doing something to him more than is
justifiable.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Chrem.</span> What, he? (<i>Aside.</i>) But
I’ll restrain myself; for that the other one should be in fear of <i>his

yourself!</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Chrem.</span> I’ll tell you. However the
case stood, <i>Clinia</i> ought still to have remained <i>at home</i>.
Perhaps his father was a little stricter than he liked: he should have
put up with it. For whom ought he to bear with, if he would not bear
with his own father? Was it reasonable that he should live after his
<i>son’s</i> humor, or <i>his son</i> after his? And as to charging him
with harshness, it is not the fact. For the severities of fathers are
generally of one character, those <i>I mean</i> who are in some degree
reasonable men.<a class = "tag" name = "torm_tag32" id = "torm_tag32"
href = "#torm_note32">32</a> They do not wish their sons to be always
wenching; they do not wish them to be always carousing; they give a
limited allowance; and yet all this tends to virtuous conduct. But when
the mind, Clitipho, has once enslaved itself by vicious appetites, it
must of necessity follow similar pursuits. This is a wise maxim, “to
take warning from others of what may be to your own advantage.”</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Clit.</span> I believe so.</p>

those things which youth is <i>naturally</i> inclined to. They regulate

Why, where is fidelity <i>gone</i>? While I, distractedly wandering,
have abandoned my country for your sake, you, in the mean time,
Antiphila, have been enriching yourself, and have forsaken me in these
troubles, <i>you</i> for whose sake I am in extreme disgrace, and have
been disobedient to my father; on whose account I am now ashamed and
grieved, that he who used to lecture me about the manners of these
women, advised me in vain, and was not able to wean me away from
her:&mdash;which, however, I&nbsp;shall now do; <i>whereas</i> when it

a judgment from the circumstances themselves.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Clin.</span> How so, prithee? For nothing in
the world could I rather wish for just now, than that I have suspected
this without reason.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Syr.</span> This, in the first place,
<i>then</i> (that you may not be ignorant of any thing that concerns
her); the old woman, who was formerly said to be her mother, was not
<i>so</i>.&mdash;She is dead: this I overheard by accident from her, as
we came along, while she was telling the other one.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Clit.</span> Pray, who is the other one?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Syr.</span> Stay; what I have begun I wish

<p><span class = "charname">Syr.</span> First of all, then, when we came
to the house, Dromo knocked at the door; a&nbsp;certain old woman came
out; when she opened the door, he directly rushed in; I&nbsp;followed;
the old woman bolted the door, <i>and</i> returned to her wool. On this
occasion might be known, Clinia, or else on none, in what pursuits she
passed her life during your absence; when we <i>thus</i> came upon a
female unexpectedly. For this circumstance then gave <i>us an</i>
opportunity of judging of the course of her daily life; <i>a thing</i>
which especially discovers what is the disposition of each individual.

<p><span class = "charname">Syr.</span> When we told her that you had

not; for it is your interest to be virtuous; those, with whom we are
acquainted, will not allow us <i>to be so</i>. For <i>our</i> lovers,
allured <i>merely</i> by our beauty, court us <i>for that</i>; when that
has faded, they transfer their affections elsewhere; <i>and</i> unless
we have made provision in the mean time for the future, we live in
destitution. <i>Now</i> with you, when you have once resolved to pass

the other. In the first place, formerly, rather than allow your son to
visit a young woman, who was then content with a very little, and to
whom any thing was acceptable, you frightened him away from here. After
that, she began, quite against her inclination, to seek a subsistence
upon the town. Now, when she can not be supported without a great
expense, you are ready to give any thing. For, that you may know how
perfectly she is trained to extravagance, in the first place, she has
already brought with her more than ten female attendants, <i>all</i>
laden with clothes and jewels of gold; if a satrap<a class = "tag" name

indulgence. Whatever comes into his head, he’ll be wishing for; nor will
he reflect whether that which he desires is right or wrong. You will not
be able to endure your estate and him going to ruin. You will refuse to
supply him: he will immediately have recourse to the means by which he

<p><span class = "charname">Clin.</span> O my <i>dear</i> Syrus, have

<p><span class = "charname">Clin.</span> Did you <i>ever</i> hear of any

<p><span class = "charname">Syr.</span> Never.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Clin.</span> And, so may the Gods prosper
me, I do not now rejoice so much on my own account as hers, whom I know
to be deserving of any honor.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Syr.</span> I believe it: but now, Clinia,
come, attend to me in my turn. For your friend’s business as
well,&mdash;it must be seen to&mdash;that it is placed in a state of
security, lest the old gentleman should now <i>come to know</i> any
thing about his mistress.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Clin.</span> O Jupiter!</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Syr.</span> Do be quiet.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Clin.</span> My Antiphila will be mine.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Syr.</span> Do you <i>still</i> interrupt me

<p><span class = "charname">Clin.</span> What can I do? My <i>dear</i>
Syrus, I’m transported with joy! Do bear with me.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Syr.</span> I’ faith, I really do bear with
you.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Clin.</span> We are blest with the life of

<p><span class = "charname">Clin.</span> Speak; I hear you.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Syr.</span> But still you’ll not mind
it.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Clin.</span> I will.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Syr.</span> This must be seen to, I say,
that your friend’s business as well is placed in a state of security.
For if you now go away from us, and leave Bacchis here, our <i>old
man</i> will immediately come to know that she is Clitipho’s mistress;
if you take her away <i>with you</i>, it will be concealed just as much
as it has been hitherto concealed.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Clin.</span> But still, Syrus, nothing can
make more against my
<span class = "pagenum">175</span>
marriage than this; for with what face am I to address my father
<i>about it</i>? You understand what I mean?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Syr.</span> Why not?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Clin.</span> What can I say? What excuse can
I make?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Syr.</span> Nay, I don’t want you to
dissemble; tell him the whole case just as it really is.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Clin.</span> What is it you say?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Syr.</span> I bid you <i>do this; tell
him</i> that you are in love with her, and want her for a wife: that
this <i>Bacchis</i> is Clitipho’s <i>mistress</i>.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Clin.</span> You require a thing that is
fair and reasonable, and easy to be done. And I suppose, then, you would
have me request my father to keep it a secret from your old man.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Syr.</span> On the contrary; to tell him
directly the matter just as it is.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Clin.</span> What? Are you quite in your
senses or sober? Why, you were for ruining him outright. For how could
he be in a state of security? Tell me <i>that</i>.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Syr.</span> For my part, I yield the palm to
this device. Here I do pride myself exultingly, in having in myself such
exquisite resources, and power of address so great, as to deceive them
both by telling the truth: so that when your old man tells ours that she
is his son’s mistress, he’ll still not believe him.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Clin.</span> But yet, by these means you
again cut off all hopes of my marriage; for as long as <i>Chremes</i>
believes that she is my mistress, he’ll not give me his daughter.
Perhaps you care little what becomes of me, so long as you provide for
him.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Syr.</span> What the plague, do you suppose
I want this pretense to be kept up for an age? ’Tis but for a single
day, <i>only</i> till I have secured the money: you be quiet; <i>I

you to do your best for it to be brought about; but in some other
way.</p>

this method; “What have I to do with it? Was it lent to me? Did I give
any orders? Had she the power to pawn my daughter without my consent?”

<i>Assigned to an old man</i>)&mdash;Ver. 1. He refers to the fact that
the Prologue was in general spoken by young men, whereas it is here

stricken in years. The Prologue was generally not recited by a person

<i>That I will first explain to you</i>)&mdash;Ver. 3. His meaning seems
to be, that he will first tell them the reason why he, who is to take a
part in the opening Scene, speaks the Prologue, which is usually spoken
by a young man who does not take part in that Scene; and that he will
then proceed to speak in character (eloquor), as Chremes, in the first
Scene. His reason for being chosen to speak the Prologue, is that he may
be a pleader (orator) for the Poet, a&nbsp;task which would be likely to
be better performed by him than by a younger man.</p>

<i>Which from a two-fold plot</i>)&mdash;Ver. 6. Vollbehr suggests that
the meaning of this line is, that though it is but one Play, it has a
two-fold plot&mdash;the intrigues of two young men with two mistresses,
and the follies of two old men. As this Play is supposed to represent
the events of two successive days, the night intervening, it has been
suggested that the reading is “duplex&mdash;ex
argumento&mdash;simplici;” the Play is “two-fold, with but one plot,” as
extending to two successive days. The Play derives its name from the
Greek words, <span class = "greek" title = "heauton">ἑαυτὸν</span>,
“himself,” and <span class = "greek" title =
"timôroumenos">τιμωρουμενὸς</span>, “tormenting.”</p>

<p><a name = "torm_note16" id = "torm_note16" href =

<i>To be a Pleader</i>)&mdash;Ver. 11. He is to be the pleader and
advocate of the Poet, to influence the Audience in his favor, and
against his adversaries; and not to explain the plot of the Play. Colman
has the following observation: “It is impossible not to regret that
there are not above ten lines of the Self-Tormentor preserved among the
Fragments of Menander. We are so deeply interested by what we see of
that character in Terence, that one can not but be curious to inquire in
what manner the Greek Poet sustained it through five Acts. The Roman
author, though he has adopted the title of the Greek Play, has so
altered the fable, that Menedemus is soon thrown into the background,
and Chremes is brought forward as the principal object; or, to vary the
allusion a little, the Menedemus of Terence seems to be a drawing in
miniature copied from a full length, as large as the life, by
Menander.”</p>

<p><a name = "torm_note18" id = "torm_note18" href =
"#torm_tag18">18.</a>
<i>The genius of his friends</i>)&mdash;Ver. 24. He alludes to a report
which had been spread, that his friends Lælius and Scipio had published
their own compositions under his name. Servilius is also mentioned by
Eugraphius as another of his patrons respecting whom similar stories
were circulated.</p>

<p><a name = "torm_note19" id = "torm_note19" href =
"#torm_tag19">19.</a>
<i>As he ran alone in the street</i>)&mdash;Ver. 31. He probably does
not intend to censure this practice entirely in Comedy, but to remind
the Audience that in some recent Play of Luscus Lavinius this had been
the sole stirring incident introduced. Plautus introduces Mercury
running in the guise of Sosia, in the fourth Scene of the Amphitryon, l.
987, and exclaiming, “For surely, why, faith, should I, a&nbsp;God, be
any less allowed to threaten the public, if it doesn’t get out of my
way, than a slave in the Comedies?” This practice can not, however, be
intended to be here censured by Plautus, as he is guilty of it in three
other instances. In the Mercator, Acanthio runs to his master Charinus,
to tell him that his mistress Pasicompsa has been seen in the ship by
his father Demipho; in the Stichus, Pinacium, a&nbsp;slave, runs to
inform his mistress Philumena that her husband has arrived in port, on
his return from Asia; and in the Mostellaria, Tranio, in haste, brings
information of the unexpected arrival of Theuropides. The “currens
servus” is also mentioned in the Prologue to the Andria, l.&nbsp;36. See
the soliloquy of Stasimus, in the Trinummus of Plautus,
l.&nbsp;1007.</p>

<i>A quiet Play</i>)&mdash;Ver. 36. “Statariam.” See the spurious
Prologue to the Bacchides of Plautus, l.&nbsp;10, and the Note to the
passage in Bohn’s Translation. The Comedy of the Romans was either
“stataria”, “motoria”, or “mixta”. “Stataria” was a Comedy which was
calm and peaceable, such as the Cistellaria of Plautus; “motoria” was
one full of action and disturbance, like his Amphitryon; while the
“Comœdia mixta” was a mixture of both, such as the Eunuchus of
Terence.</p>

<p><a name = "torm_note21" id = "torm_note21" href =

<i>What in each character</i>)&mdash;Ver. 47. “In utramque partem
ingenium quid possit meum.” This line is entirely omitted in Vollbehr’s
edition; but it appears to be merely a typographical error.</p>

<p><a name = "torm_note22" id = "torm_note22" href =
"#torm_tag22">22.</a>
<i>How little work is done here</i>)&mdash;Ver. 72. Vollbehr thinks that
his meaning is, that he is quite vexed to see so little progress made,
in spite of his neighbor’s continual vexation and turmoil, and that, as
he says in the next line, he is of opinion that if he were to cease
working himself, and were to overlook his servants, he would get far
more done. It is more generally thought to be an objection which Chremes
suggests that Menedemus may possibly make.</p>

<p><a name = "torm_note23" id = "torm_note23" href =
"#torm_tag23">23.</a>
<i>I am a man</i>)&mdash;Ver. 77. “Homo sum: humani nihil a me alienum
puto.” St. Augustine says, that at the delivery of this sentiment, the
Theatre resounded with applause; and deservedly, indeed, for it is
replete with the very essence of benevolence and disregard of self.
Cicero quotes the passage in his work De Officiis, B.&nbsp;i.,
c.&nbsp;9. The remarks of Sir Richard Steele upon this passage, in the
Spectator, No. 502, are worthy to be transcribed at length. “The Play
was the Self-Tormentor. It is from the beginning to the end a perfect
picture of human life, but I did not observe in the whole one passage
that could raise a laugh. How well-disposed must that people be, who
could be entertained with satisfaction by so sober and polite mirth! In
the first Scene of the Comedy, when one of the old men accuses the other
of impertinence for interposing in his affairs, he answers, ‘I am a man,
and can not help feeling any sorrow that can arrive at man.’ It is said
this sentence was received with an universal applause. There can not be
a greater argument of the general good understanding of a people, than
their sudden consent to give their approbation of a sentiment which has
no emotion in it. If it were spoken with ever so great skill in the
actor, the manner of uttering that sentence could have nothing in it
which could strike any but people of the greatest humanity&mdash;nay,
people elegant and skillful in observation upon it. It is possible that
he may have laid his hand on his heart, and with a winning insinuation
in his countenance, expressed to his neighbor that he was a man who made
his case his own; yet I will engage, a&nbsp;player in Covent Garden
might hit such an attitude a thousand times before he would have been
regarded.”</p>

<p><a name = "torm_note24" id = "torm_note24" href =

<i>Take off my shoes</i>)&mdash;Ver. 124. As to the “socci,” or low
shoes of the ancients, see the Notes to the Trinummus of Plautus, l.
720, in Bohn’s Translation. It was the especial duty of certain slaves
to take off the shoes of their masters.</p>

<p><a name = "torm_note25" id = "torm_note25" href =
"#torm_tag25">25.</a>
<i>To spread the couches</i>)&mdash;Ver. 125. The “lecti” or “couches”
upon which the ancients reclined at meals, have been enlarged upon in
the Notes to Plautus, where full reference is also made to the “coena”
or “dinner,” and other meals of the Romans.</p>

<p><a name = "torm_note26" id = "torm_note26" href =
"#torm_tag26">26.</a>
<i>Provide me with dress</i>)&mdash;Ver. 130. It was the custom for the
mistress and female servants in each family to make the clothes of the
master. Thus in the Fasti of Ovid, B. ii., l. 746, Lucretia is found
amidst her female servants, making a cloak, or “lacerna,” for her
husband. Suetonius says that Augustus refused to wear any garments not
woven by his female relations. Cooke seems to think that “vestiant”
alludes to the very act of putting the clothes upon a person. He says,
“The better sort of people had eating-dresses, which are here alluded
to. These dresses were light garments, to put on as soon as they had
bathed. They commonly bathed before eating, and the chief meal was in
the evening.” This, however, does not seem to be the meaning of the
passage, although Colman has adopted it. We may here remark that the
censure here described is not unlike that mentioned in the Prologue to

<i>Festival of Bacchus, “Dionysia”</i>)&mdash;Ver. 162. It is generally
supposed that there were four Festivals called the Dionysia, during the
year, at Athens. The first was the Rural, or Lesser Dionysia, <span
class = "greek" title = "kat’ agrous">κατ᾽ ἀγροὺς</span>, a&nbsp;vintage
festival, which was celebrated in the “Demi” or boroughs of Attica, in
honor of Bacchus, in the month Poseidon. This was the most ancient of
the Festivals, and was held with the greatest merriment and freedom; the
slaves then enjoyed the same amount of liberty as they did at the
Saturnalia at Rome. The second Festival, which was called the Lensea,
from <span class = "greek" title = "lênus">ληνὸς</span>,
a&nbsp;wine-press, was celebrated in the month Gamelion, with Scenic
contests in Tragedy and Comedy. The third Dionysian Festival was the
Anthesteria, or “Spring feast,” being celebrated during three days in
the month Anthesterion. The first day was called <span class = "greek"
title = "pithoigia">πιθοίγια</span>, or “the Opening of the casks,” as
on that day the casks were opened to taste the wine of the preceding
year. The second day was called <span class = "greek" title =
"choes">χοες</span>, from <span class = "greek" title =
"chous">χοῦς</span>, “a cup,” and was probably devoted to drinking. The
third day was called <span class = "greek" title =
"chutroi">χυτροὶ</span>, from <span class = "greek" title =
"chutros">χυτρὸς</span>, “a pot,” as on it persons offered pots with
flower-seeds or cooked vegetables to Dionysus or Bacchus. The fourth
Attic festival of Dionysius was celebrated in the month Elaphebolion,
and was called the Dionysia <span class = "greek" title = "en astei, Astika">ἐν ἄστει, Αστικὰ</span>, or <span class = "greek" title =
"Megala">Μεγαλὰ</span>, the “City” or “great” festival. It was
celebrated with great magnificence, processions and dramatic
representations forming part of the ceremonial. From Greece, by way of
Sicily, the Bacchanalia, or festivals of Bacchus, were introduced into
Rome, where they became the scenes of and pretext for every kind of vice
and debauchery, until at length they were put down in the year <span
class = "smallroman">B.C.</span> 187, with a strong hand, by the Consuls
Spurius Posthumius Albinus and Q. Marcius Philippus; from which period
the words “bacchor” and “bacchator” became synonymous with the practice
of every kind of vice and turpitude that could outrage common decency.

<i>In a mourning dress</i>)&mdash;Ver. 286. Among the Greeks, in
general, mourning for the dead seems to have lasted till the thirtieth
day after the funeral, and during that period black dresses were worn.
The Romans also wore mourning for the dead, which seems, in the time of
the Republic, to have been black or dark blue for either sex. Under the
Empire the men continued to wear black, but the women wore white. No
jewels or ornaments were worn upon these occasions.</p>

<i>With no worthless woman’s trumpery</i>)&mdash;Ver. 289. By “nullâ
malâ re muliebri” he clearly means that they did not find her painted up
with the cosmetics which some women were in the habit of using. Such
preparations for the face as white-lead, wax, antimony, or vermilion,
well deserve the name of “mala res.” A&nbsp;host of these cosmetics will
be found described in Ovid’s Fragment “On the Care of the Complexion,”
and much information upon this subject is given in various passages in
the Art of Love. In the Remedy of Love, l. 351, Ovid speaks of these
practices in the following terms: “At the moment, too, when she shall be
smearing her face with the cosmetics laid up on it, you may come into
the presence of your mistress, and don’t let shame prevent you. You will
find there boxes, and a thousand colors of objects; and you will see
‘oesypum,’ the ointment of the fleece, trickling down and flowing upon
her heated bosom. These drugs, Phineus, smell like thy tables; not once
alone has sickness been caused by this to my stomach.” Lucretius also,
in his Fourth Book, l. 1168, speaks of a female who “covers herself with
noxious odors, and whom her female attendants fly from to a distance,
and chuckle by stealth.” See also the Mostellaria of Plautus, Act I.,
Scene 3, l. 135, where Philematium is introduced making her toilet on
the stage.</p>

<i>Your Bacchis, whom we are bringing</i>)&mdash;Ver. 310. Colman has
the following remark: “Here we enter upon the other part of the table,

making Syrus bring Clitipho’s mistress along with Antiphila. This part

a&nbsp;proverbial expression, implying an easy and secure repose. It is
also used by Plautus, and is found in a fragment of the <span class =

<i>Still do that which I said</i>)&mdash;Ver. 346. “Perge porro, tamen
istue ago.” Stallbaum observes that the meaning is: “Although I’m going
off, I’m still attending to what you’re saying.” According to Schmieder
and others, it means: “Call on just as you please, I&nbsp;shall persist
in sending Bacchis away.”</p>

"#torm_tag47">47.</a>
<i>Words of double meaning</i>)&mdash;Ver. 372. “Inversa verba, eversas
cervices tuas.” “Inversa verba” clearly means, words with a double
meaning, or substituted for others by previous arrangement, like
correspondence by cipher. Lucretius uses the words in this sense, B. i.,
l. 643. A&nbsp;full account of the secret signs and correspondence in
use among the ancients will be found in the 16th and 17th Epistles of
the Heroides of Ovid, in his Amours, B. i., El. 4, and in various
passages of the Art of Love. See also the Asinaria of Plautus, l. 780.
It is not known for certain what “eversa cervix” here means; it may mean
the turning of the neck in some particular manner by way of a hint or to
give a sidelong look, or it may allude to the act of snatching a kiss on
the sly, which might lead to a discovery.</p>

<i>I can scarce endure it</i>)&mdash;Ver. 400. Colman has the following
remark on this passage: “Madame Dacier, contrary to the authority of all
editions and MSS., adopts a conceit of her father’s in this place, and
places this speech to Clitipho, whom she supposes to have retired to a
hiding-place, where he might overhear the conversation, and from whence
he peeps out to make this speech to Syrus. This she calls an agreeable
<i>jeu de théâtre</i>, and doubts not but all lovers of Terence will be
obliged to her father for so ingenious a remark; but it is to be feared
that critical sagacity will not be so lavish of acknowledgments as
filial piety. There does not appear the least foundation for this remark
in the Scene, nor has the Poet given us the least room to doubt of
Clitipho being actually departed. To me, instead of an agreeable <i>jeu
de théâtre</i>, it appears a most absurd and ridiculous device;
particularly vicious in this place, as it most injudiciously tends to
interrupt the course of Clinia’s more interesting passion, so admirably
delineated in this little Scene.”</p>

<p><a name = "torm_note50" id = "torm_note50" href =

<i>It is now daybreak</i>)&mdash;Ver. 410. Though this is the only Play
which includes more than one day in the action, it is not the only one
in which the day is represented as breaking. The Amphitryon and the
Curculio of Plautus commence before daybreak, and the action is carried
on into the middle of the day. Madame Dacier absolutely considers it
<i>as a fact beyond all doubt</i>, that the Roman Audience went home
after the first two Acts of the Play, and returned for the
representation of the third the next morning at daybreak. Scaliger was
of the same opinion; but it is not generally entertained by
Commentators.</p>

<i>In tasting only</i>)&mdash;Ver. 457. “Pytiso” was the name given to
the nasty practice of tasting wine, and then spitting it out; offensive
in a man, but infinitely more so in a woman. It seems in those times to
have been done by persons who wished to give themselves airs in the
houses of private persons; at the present day it is probably confined to
wine-vaults and sale-rooms where wine is put up to auction, and even
there it is practiced much more than is either necessary or agreeable.
Doubtless Bacchis did it to show her exquisite taste in the matter of
wines.</p>

<i>Is too acid</i>)&mdash;Ver. 458. “Asperum;” meaning that the wine was
not old enough for her palate. The great fault of the Greek wines was
their tartness, for which reason sea-water was mixed with them all
except the Chian, which was the highest class of wine.</p>

<i>All the casks, all the vessels</i>)&mdash;Ver. 460. “Dolia omnia,
omnes serias.” The finer kinds of wine were drawn off from the “dolia,”
or large vessels, into the “amphoræ,” which, like the “dolia,” were made
of earth, and sometimes of glass. The mouths of the vessels were stopped
tight by a plug of wood or cork, which was made impervious to the
atmosphere by being rubbed over with a composition of pitch, clay, wax,
or gypsum. On the outside, the title of the wine was painted, and among
the Romans the date of the vintage was denoted by the names of the
Consuls then in office. When the vessels were of glass, small tickets or
labels, called “pittacia,” were suspended from them, stating to a
similar effect. The “seriæ” were much the same as the “dolia,” perhaps
somewhat smaller; they were both long, bell-mouthed vessels of
earthen-ware, formed of the best clay, and lined with pitch while hot
from the furnace. “Seriæ” were also used to contain oil and other
liquids; and in the Captivi of Plautus the word is applied to pans used
for the purpose of salting meat. “Relino” signifies the act of taking
the seal of pitch or wax off the stopper of the wine-vessel.</p>

<i>This night with my eyes</i>)&mdash;Ver. 491. Colman has the following
Note here: “Hedelin obstinately contends from this passage, that neither
Chremes nor any of his family went to bed the whole night; the contrary
of which is evident, as Menage observes, from the two next Scenes. For
why should Syrus take notice of his being up so early, if he had never
retired to rest? Or would Chremes have reproached Clitipho for his
behavior the night before, had the feast never been interrupted?
Eugraphius’s interpretation of these words is natural and obvious, who
explains them to signify that the anxiety of Chremes to restore Clinia
to Menedemus broke his rest.”</p>

<p><a name = "torm_note60" id = "torm_note60" href =

<i>That they may not perceive</i>)&mdash;Ver. 511. Madame Dacier

pretense to engage Menedemus to return home, and not to his labors in
the field, as he had at first intended.</p>

<p><a name = "torm_note61" id = "torm_note61" href =

<i>Old age of an eagle</i>)&mdash;Ver. 521. This was a proverbial
expression, signifying a hale and vigorous old age. It has been
suggested, too, that it alludes to the practice of some old men, who
drink more than they eat. It was vulgarly said that eagles never die of
old age, and that when, by reason of their beaks growing inward, they
are unable to feed upon their prey, they live by sucking the blood.</p>

<p><a name = "torm_note62" id = "torm_note62" href =

<i>Not like those of former days</i>)&mdash;Ver. 524. Syrus, by showing
himself an admirer of the good old times, a&nbsp;“laudator temporis
acti,” is wishful to flatter the vanity of Chremes, as it is a feeling
common to old age, perhaps by no means an unamiable one, to think former
times better than the present. Aged people feel grateful to those happy
hours when their hopes were bright, and every thing was viewed from the
sunny side of life.</p>

<i>And truly, Chremes</i>)&mdash;Ver. 557. Some suppose that this is
said in apparent candor by Syrus, in order the more readily to throw
Chremes off his guard. Other Commentators, again, fancy these words to
be said by Syrus in a low voice, aside, which seems not improbable; it
being a just retribution on Chremes for his recommendation, however well
intended: in that case, Chremes probably overhears it, if we may judge
from his answer.</p>

Antiphila is shortly to be acknowledged as the daughter of Chremes, she
is not therefore in company with the other women at the feast, who are
Courtesans, but with the wife of Chremes, and consequently free from
reproach or scandal.</p>

<i>You shall soon know</i>)&mdash;Ver. 612. Madame Dacier suggests that
Chremes is prevented by his wife’s coming from making a proposal to
advance the money himself, on the supposition that it will be a
lucrative speculation. This notion is contradicted by Colman, who adds
the following note from Eugraphius: “Syrus pretends to have concerted
this plot against Menedemus, in order to trick him out of some money to
be given to Clinia’s supposed mistress. Chremes, however, does not
approve of this: yet it serves to carry on the plot; for when Antiphila
proves afterward to be the daughter of Chremes, he necessarily becomes
the debtor of Bacchis, and is obliged to lay down the sum for which he
imagines his daughter is pledged.”</p>

gain a loss.</p>

<i>That she might not be without</i>)&mdash;Ver. 652. Madame Dacier
observes upon this passage, that the ancients thought themselves guilty
of a heinous offense if they suffered their children to die without
having bestowed on them some of their property; it was consequently the
custom of the women, before exposing children, to attach to them some
jewel or trinket among their clothes, hoping thereby to avoid incurring
the guilt above mentioned, and to ease their consciences.</p>

<i>Saving of yourself and her</i>)&mdash;Ver. 653. Madame Dacier says
that the meaning of this passage is this: Chremes tells his wife that by
having given this ring, she has done two good acts instead of
one&mdash;she has both cleared her conscience and saved the child; for
had there been no ring or token exposed with the infant, the finder
would not have been at the trouble of taking care of it, but might have
left it to perish, never suspecting it would be inquired after, or
himself liberally rewarded for having preserved it.</p>

Antiphila should so soon be acknowledged as the daughter of Chremes,
lest he may lose the opportunity of obtaining the money, and be punished
as well, in case the imposition is detected, and Bacchis discovered to
be the mistress of Clitipho and not of Clinia.</p>

"#torm_tag79">79.</a>
<i>Retribution</i>)&mdash;Ver. 668. “Infortunium!” was the name by which
the slaves commonly denoted a beating. Colman has the following remark
here: “Madame Dacier, and most of the later critics who have implicitly
followed her, tell us that in the interval between the third and fourth
Acts, Syrus has been present at the interview between Chremes and
Antiphila within. The only difficulty in this doctrine is how to
reconcile it to the apparent ignorance of Syrus, which he discovers at
the entrance of Clinia. But this objection, says she, is easily
answered. Syrus having partly heard Antiphila’s story, and finding
things likely to take an unfavorable turn, retires to consider what is
best to be done. But surely this is a most unnatural impatience at so
critical a conjuncture; and, after all, would it not be better to take
up the matter just where Terence has left it, and to suppose that Syrus
knew nothing more of the affair than what might be collected from the
late conversation between Chremes and Sostrata, at which we know he was
present? This at once accounts for his apprehensions, which he betrayed
even during that Scene, as well as for his imperfect knowledge of the
real state of the case, till apprised of the whole by Clinia.”</p>

<p><a name = "torm_note80" id = "torm_note80" href =
"#torm_tag80">80.</a>
<i>With my sides covered</i>)&mdash;Ver. 673. He most probably alludes
to the custom of tying up the slaves by their hands, after stripping
them naked, when of course their “latera” or “sides” would be exposed,
and come in for a share of the lashes.</p>

<p><a name = "torm_note81" id = "torm_note81" href =
"#torm_tag81">81.</a>
<i>Runaway money</i>)&mdash;Ver. 678. “Fugitivum argentum.” Madame
Dacier suggests that this is a bad translation of the words of Menander,
which were “<span class = "greek" title = "apostrepsein ton drapetan chruson">ἀποστρέψειν τὸν δραπέταν χρυσὸν</span>” where “<span class =
"greek" title = "chrusos">χρυσὸς</span>” signified both “gold” and the
name of a slave.</p>

<p><a name = "torm_note82" id = "torm_note82" href =
"#torm_tag82">82.</a>
<i>If the sky were to fall</i>)&mdash;Ver. 719. He means those who
create unnecessary difficulties in their imagination. Colman quotes the
following remark from Patrick: “There is a remarkable passage in
Arrian’s Account of Alexander, lib. iv., where he tells us that some
embassadors from the Celtic, being asked by Alexander what in the world
they dreaded most, answered, ‘That they feared lest the sky should fall
[upon them].’ Alexander, who expected to hear himself named, was
surprised at an answer which signified that they thought themselves
beyond the reach of all human power, plainly implying that nothing could
hurt them, unless he would suppose impossibilities, or a total
destruction of nature.” Aristotle, in his Physics, B. iv., informs us
that it was the early notion of ignorant nations that the sky was
supported on the shoulders of Atlas, and that when he let go of it, it
would fall.</p>

<p><a name = "torm_note83" id = "torm_note83" href =
"#torm_tag83">83.</a>
<i>To a very fine purpose</i>)&mdash;Ver. 723. “Satis pol proterve,”
&amp;c. C.&nbsp;Lælius was said to have assisted Terence in the
composition of his Plays, and in confirmation of this, the following
story is told by Cornelius Nepos: “C.&nbsp;Lælius, happening to pass the
Matronalia [a Festival on the first of March, when the husband, for once
in the year, was bound to obey the wife] at his villa near Puteoli, was
told that dinner was waiting, but still neglected the summons. At last,
when he made his appearance, he excused himself by saying that he had
been in a particular vein of composition, and quoted certain lines which
occur in the Heautontimorumenos, namely, those beginning ‘Satis pol
proterve me Syri promissa huc induxerunt.’”</p>

<p><a name = "torm_note84" id = "torm_note84" href =
"#torm_tag84">84.</a>
<i>They’re asleep</i>)&mdash;Ver. 730. “Dormiunt.” This is clearly used
figuratively, though Hedelin interprets it literally.</p>

<p><a name = "torm_note85" id = "torm_note85" href =
"#torm_tag85">85.</a>
<i>Farm here on the right-hand side</i>)&mdash;Ver. 732. Cooke suggests
that the Poet makes Bacchis call the house of Charinus “villa,” and that
of Chremes “fundus” (which signifies “a farm-house,” or “farm”), for the
purpose of exalting the one and depreciating the other in the hearing of
Syrus.</p>

<p><a name = "torm_note86" id = "torm_note86" href =
"#torm_tag86">86.</a>
<i>The feast of Bacchus</i>)&mdash;Ver. 733. This passage goes far to
prove that the Dionysia here mentioned as being celebrated, were those
<span class = "greek" title = "kat’ agrous">κατ᾽ ἀγρους</span>, or the
“rural Dionysia.”</p>

<p><a name = "torm_note87" id = "torm_note87" href =
"#torm_tag87">87.</a>
<i>Let’s be going</i>)&mdash;Ver. 742. Colman here remarks to the
following effect: “There is some difficulty in this and the next speech
in the original, and the Commentators have been puzzled to make sense of
them. It seems to me that the Poet’s intention is no more than this:
Bacchis expresses some reluctance to act under the direction of Syrus,
but is at length prevailed on, finding that he can by those means
contrive to pay her the money which he has promised her.”</p>

<p><a name = "torm_note88" id = "torm_note88" href =
"#torm_tag88">88.</a>
<i>Rigorous law</i>)&mdash;Ver. 796. Cicero mentions the same proverb in
his work De Officiis, B. i., ch. 10, substituting the word “injuria” for
“malitia.” “‘Extreme law, extreme injustice,’ is now become a stale
proverb in discourse.” The same sentiment is found in the Fragments of
Menander.</p>

<p><a name = "torm_note89" id = "torm_note89" href =
"#torm_tag89">89.</a>
<i>Are sanctioned by custom</i>)&mdash;Ver. 839. He inveighs, perhaps
justly, against the tyranny of custom; but in selecting this occasion
for doing so, he does not manifest any great affection for his
newly-found daughter.</p>

<p><a name = "torm_note90" id = "torm_note90" href =
"#torm_tag90">90.</a>
<i>Assistant, prompter, and director</i>)&mdash;Ver. 875. The three
terms here used are borrowed from the stage. “Adjutor” was the person
who assisted the performers either by voice or gesture; “monitor” was
the prompter; and “præmonstrator” was the person who in the rehearsal
trained the actor in his part.</p>

<p><a name = "torm_note91" id = "torm_note91" href =
"#torm_tag91">91.</a>
<i>Dolt, post, ass</i>)&mdash;Ver. 877. There is a similar passage in
the Bacchides of Plautus, l. 1087. “Whoever there are in any place
whatsoever, whoever have been, and whoever shall be in time to come,
fools, blockheads, idiots, dolts, sots, oafs, lubbers, I&nbsp;singly by
far exceed them all in folly and absurd ways.”</p>

<p><a name = "torm_note92" id = "torm_note92" href =
"#torm_tag92">92.</a>
<i>Mould the countenances of people</i>)&mdash;Ver. 887. He means that
Syrus not only lays his plots well, but teaches the performers to put on
countenances suitable to the several parts they are to act.</p>

<p><a name = "torm_note93" id = "torm_note93" href =
"#torm_tag93">93.</a>
<i>Has moulded your son</i>)&mdash;Ver. 898. “Mire finxit.” He
sarcastically uses the same word, “fingo,” which Chremes himself
employed in l. 887.</p>

<p><a name = "torm_note94" id = "torm_note94" href =
"#torm_tag94">94.</a>
<i>Substance to suffice for ten days</i>)&mdash;Ver. 909. “Familia” here
means “property,” as producing sustenance. Colman, however, has
translated the passage: “Mine is scarce a ten-days’ family.”</p>

<p><a name = "torm_note95" id = "torm_note95" href =
"#torm_tag95">95.</a>
<i> His she-friend rather</i>)&mdash;Ver. 911. Menedemus speaks of
“amico,” a&nbsp;male friend, which Chremes plays upon by saying
“amicae,” which literally meant a she-friend, and was the usual name by
which decent people called a mistress.</p>

<p><a name = "torm_note96" id = "torm_note96" href =
"#torm_tag96">96.</a>
<i>And forsake you</i>)&mdash;Ver. 924. Madame Dacier observes here,
that one of the great beauties of this Scene consists in Chremes
retorting on Menedemus the very advice given by himself at the beginning
of the Play.</p>

<p><a name = "torm_note97" id = "torm_note97" href =
"#torm_tag97">97.</a>
<i>Which he has done to me</i>)&mdash;Ver. 954. Colman has the following
Note: “The departure of Menedemus here is very abrupt, seeming to be in
the midst of a conversation; and his re-entrance with Clitipho, already
supposed to be apprised of what has passed between the two old
gentlemen, is equally precipitate. Menage imagines that some verses are
lost here. Madame Dacier strains hard to defend the Poet, and fills up
the void of time by her old expedient of making the Audience wait to see
Chremes walk impatiently to and fro, till a sufficient time is elapsed
for Menedemus to have given Clitipho a summary account of the cause of
his father’s anger. The truth is, that a too strict observance of the
unity of place will necessarily produce such absurdities; and there are
several other instances of the like nature in Terence.”</p>

<p><a name = "torm_note98" id = "torm_note98" href =
"#torm_tag98">98.</a>
<i>Intrusted every thing</i>)&mdash;Ver. 966. This is an early instance
of a trusteeship and a guardianship.</p>

<p><a name = "torm_note99" id = "torm_note99" href =
"#torm_tag99">99.</a>
<i>It’s all over</i>)&mdash;Ver. 974. “Ilicet,” literally, “you may go
away.” This was the formal word with which funeral ceremonies and trials
at law were concluded.</p>

<p><a name = "torm_note100" id = "torm_note100" href =
"#torm_tag100">100.</a>
<i>Look out for an altar</i>)&mdash;Ver. 975. He alludes to the practice
of slaves taking refuge at altars when they had committed any fault, and
then suing for pardon through a “precator” or “mediator.” See the
Mostellaria of Plautus, l.&nbsp;1074, where Tranio takes refuge at the
altar from the vengeance of his master, Theuropides.</p>

<p><a name = "torm_note101" id = "torm_note101" href =
"#torm_tag101">101.</a>
<i>Amounts to the same thing</i>)&mdash;Ver. 1010. “Quam quidem redit ad
integrum eadem oratio;” meaning, “it amounts to one and the same thing,”
or, “it is all the same thing,” whether you do or whether you don’t
know.</p>

<p><a name = "torm_note102" id = "torm_note102" href =
"#torm_tag102">102.</a>
<i>Because my daughter has been found</i>)&mdash;Ver. 1018. This
sentence has given much trouble to the Commentators. Colman has the
following just remarks upon it: “Madame Dacier, as well as all the rest
of the Commentators, has stuck at these words. Most of them imagine she
means to say, that the discovery of Antiphila is a plain proof that she
is not barren. Madame Dacier supposes that she intimates such a proof to
be easy, because Clitipho and Antiphila were extremely alike; which
sense she thinks immediately confirmed by the answer of Chremes.
I&nbsp;can not agree with any of them, and think that the whole
difficulty of the passage here, as in many other places, is entirely of
their own making. Sostrata could not refer to the reply of Chremes,
because she could not possibly tell what it would be; but her own speech
is intended as an answer to his preceding one, which she takes as a
sneer on her late wonderful discovery of a daughter; imagining that he
means to insinuate that she could at any time with equal ease make out
the proofs of the birth of her son. The elliptical mode of expression so
usual with Terence, together with the refinements of Commentators, seem
to have created all the obscurity.”</p>

<p><a name = "torm_note103" id = "torm_note103" href =
"#torm_tag103">103.</a>
<i>By your profligacy</i>)&mdash;Ver. 1036. It is probably this
ebullition of Comic anger which is referred to by Horace, in his Art of
Poetry:</p>

<div class = "poem">
<p>“Interdum tamen et vocem Comœdia tollit,</p>
<p>Iratusque Chremes tumido delitigat ore:”</p>
</div>

<p>“Yet sometimes Comedy as well raises her voice, and enraged Chremes
censures in swelling phrase.”</p>

<p><a name = "torm_note104" id = "torm_note104" href =
"#torm_tag104">104.</a>
<i>I don’t know as to the Gods</i>)&mdash;Ver. 1037. “Deos nescio.” The
Critic Lambinis, in his letter to Charles the Ninth of France, accuses
Terence of impiety in this passage. Madame Dacier has, however, well
observed, that the meaning is not “I care not for the Gods,” but “I know
not what the Gods will do.”</p>

<p><a name = "torm_note105" id = "torm_note105" href =
"#torm_tag105">105.</a>
<i>And close with the offer</i>)&mdash;Ver. 1048. “Firmas.” This
ratification or affirmation would be made by Menedemus using the formal
word “Accipio,” “I accept.”</p>

<p><a name = "torm_note106" id = "torm_note106" href =
"#torm_tag106">106.</a>
<i>Freckled face</i>)&mdash;Ver. 1060. Many take “sparso ore” here to
mean “wide-mouthed.” Lemonnier thinks that must be the meaning, as he
has analyzed the other features of her countenance. There is, however,
no reason why he should not speak of her complexion; and it seems, not
improbably, to have the same meaning as the phrase “os lentiginosum,”
“a&nbsp;freckled face.”</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Micio</span> and Demea are two brothers of
dissimilar tempers. Demea is married, and lives a country life, while
his brother remains single, and resides in Athens. Demea has two sons,
the elder of whom, Æschinus, has been adopted by Micio. Being allowed by
his indulgent uncle to gratify his inclinations without restraint,
Æschinus has debauched Pamphila, the daughter of a widow named Sostrata.
Having, however, promised to marry the young woman, he has been pardoned
for the offense, and it has been kept strictly secret. Ctesipho, who
lives in the country with his father under great restraint, on visiting
the city, falls in love with a certain Music-girl, who belongs to the
Procurer Sannio. To screen his brother, Æschinus takes the
responsibility of the affair on himself, and succeeds in carrying off
the girl for him. Demea, upon hearing of this, censures Micio for his
ill-timed indulgence, the bad effects of which are thus exemplified in
Æschinus; and at the same time lauds the steady conduct and frugality of
Ctesipho, who has been brought up under his own supervision. Shortly
after this, Sostrata hears the story about the Music-girl, at the very
time that her daughter Pamphila is in labor. She naturally supposes that
Æschinus has deserted her daughter for another, and hastens to acquaint
Hegio, her kinsman, with the fact. Meantime Demea learns that Ctesipho
has taken part in carrying off the Music-girl, whereon Syrus invents a
story, and screens Ctesipho for the moment. Demea is next informed by
Hegio of the conduct of Æschinus toward Pamphila. Wishing to find his
brother, he is purposely sent on a fruitless errand by Syrus, on which
he wanders all over the city to no purpose. Micio having now been
informed by Hegio, and knowing that the intentions of Æschinus toward
Pamphila are not changed, accompanies him to the house of Sostrata, whom
he consoles by his promise that Æschinus shall marry her daughter. Demea
then returns from his search, and, rushing into Micio’s house, finds his
son Ctesipho there carousing; on which he exclaims vehemently against
Micio, who uses his best endeavors to soothe him, and finally with
success. He now determines to become kind and considerate for the
future. At his request, Pamphila is brought to Micio’s house; and the
nuptials are celebrated. Micio, at the earnest request of Demea and
Æschinus, marries Sostrata; Hegio has a competency allowed him; and
Syrus and his wife Phrygia are made free. The Play concludes with a
serious warning from Demea, who advises his relatives not to squander
their means in riotous living; but, on the contrary, to bear admonition
and to submit to restraint in a spirit of moderation and
thankfulness.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">As Demea</span> has two <i>sons</i>, young
men, he gives Æschinus to his brother Micio to be adopted <i>by him</i>;
but he retains Ctesipho: him, captivated with the charms of a
Music-girl, <i>and</i> under a harsh and strict father, his brother
Æschinus screens; the scandal of the affair and the amour he takes upon
himself; at last, he carries the Music-girl away from the Procurer. This
same Æschinus has <i>previously</i> debauched a poor woman,
a&nbsp;citizen of Athens, and has given his word that she shall be his
wife. Demea upbraids him, <i>and</i> is greatly vexed; afterward,
however, when the truth is discovered, Æschinus marries <i>the girl</i>
who has been debauched; <i>and</i>, his harsh father Demea <i>now</i>
softened, Ctesipho retains the Music-girl.</p>

that you only are taking your pleasure, while she herself is miserable.
As for myself, in consequence of my son not having returned home, what
do I imagine? In what ways am I not disturbed? For fear lest he may
either have
<span class = "pagenum">202</span>
taken cold,<a class = "tag" name = "adel_tag22" id = "adel_tag22" href =
"#adel_note22">22</a> or have fallen down somewhere, or have broken some
<i>limb</i>. Oh dear! that any man should take it into his head, or find
out what is dearer <i>to him</i> than he is to himself! And yet he is
not my son, but my brother’s. He is quite different in disposition. I,
from my very youth upward, have lived a comfortable town life, and
<i>taken</i> my ease; and, what they esteem a piece of luck, I&nbsp;have
never had a wife. He, on the contrary to all this, has spent his life in
the country, <i>and</i> has always lived laboriously and penuriously. He
married a wife, <i>and</i> has two sons. This one, the elder of them,
I&nbsp;have adopted. I&nbsp;have brought him up from an infant,
<i>and</i> considered <i>and</i> loved him as my own. In him I centre my
delight; this <i>object</i> alone is dear to me. On the other hand,
I&nbsp;take all due care that he may hold me equally dear.
I&nbsp;give&mdash;I overlook; I&nbsp;do not judge it necessary to exert
my authority in every thing; in fine, the things that youth prompts to,
<i>and</i> that others do unknown to their fathers, I&nbsp;have used my
son not to conceal from me. For he, who, as the practice is, will dare
to tell a lie to or to deceive his father, will still more dare <i>to do
so</i> to others. I&nbsp;think it better to restrain children through a
sense of shame and liberal treatment, than through fear. On these points
my brother does not agree with me, nor do they please him. He often
comes to me exclaiming, “What are you about, Micio? Why do you ruin for
us this youth? Why does he intrigue? Why does he drink? Why do you
supply him with the means for these goings on? You indulge him with too
much dress; you are very inconsiderate.” He himself is too strict,
beyond what is just and reasonable; and he is very much mistaken, in my
opinion, at all events, who thinks that an authority is more firm or
more lasting which is established by force, than that which is founded
on affection. Such is my mode of reasoning;</p>
<span class = "pagenum">203</span>
and thus do I persuade myself. He, who, compelled by harsh treatment,
does his duty, so long as he thinks it will be known, is on his guard:
if he hopes that it will be concealed, he again returns to his natural
bent. He whom you have secured by kindness, acts from inclination; he is
anxious to return like for like; present and absent, he will be the
same. This is the duty of a parent, to accustom a son to do what is
right rather of his own choice, than through fear of another. In this
the father differs from the master: he who can not do this, let him
confess that he does not know how to govern children. But is not this
the very man of whom I was speaking? Surely it is he. I&nbsp;don’t know
why it is I see him out of spirits; I&nbsp;suppose he’ll now be scolding
as usual. Demea, I&nbsp;am glad to see you well.<a class = "tag" name =

would be so? (<i>To <span class = "charname">Demea</span>.</i>) What has
he been doing?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dem.</span> What has he been doing? He, who
is ashamed of nothing, and fears no one, nor thinks that any law can
control him. But I pass by what has been previously done: what a thing
he has just perpetrated!</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Mic.</span> Why, what is it?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dem.</span> He has broken open a door,<a
class = "tag" name = "adel_tag26" id = "adel_tag26" href =
"#adel_note26">26</a> and forced his way
<span class = "pagenum">204</span>
into another person’s house, beaten to death the master himself, and all
the household, <i>and</i> carried off a wench whom he had a fancy for.
All people are exclaiming that it was a most disgraceful proceeding. How
many, Micio, told me of this as I was coming here? It is in every body’s
mouth. In fine, if an example must be cited, does he not see his brother
giving his attention to business, <i>and</i> living frugally and soberly
in the country? No action of his <i>is</i> like this. When I say this to
him, Micio, I&nbsp;say it to you. You allow him to be corrupted.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Mic.</span> Never is there any thing more
unreasonable than a man who wants experience, who thinks nothing right
except what he himself has done.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dem.</span> What is the meaning of that?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Mic.</span> Because, Demea, you misjudge
these matters. It is no heinous crime, believe me, for a young man to
intrigue or to drink; it is not; nor yet for him to break open a door.
If neither I nor you did so, it was poverty that did not allow us to do
<i>so</i>. Do you now claim that as a merit to yourself, which you then
did from necessity? That is unfair; for if we had had the means to do
so, we should have done <i>the same</i>. And, if you were a man, you
would now suffer that <i>other son</i> of yours to act <i>thus</i> now,
while his age will excuse it, rather than, when he has got you, after
long wishing it, out of the way, he should still do <i>so</i>, at a
future day, <i>and</i> at an age more unsuited.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dem.</span> O Jupiter! You, sir, are driving
me to distraction. Is it not a heinous thing for a young man to do these
things?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Mic.</span> Oh! do listen to me, and do not
everlastingly din me upon this subject. You gave me your son to adopt;
he became mine; if he offends in any thing, Demea, he offends against
me: in that case I shall bear the greater part <i>of the
inconvenience</i>. Does he feast,<a class = "tag" name = "adel_tag27" id
= "adel_tag27" href = "#adel_note27">27</a> does he drink, does he smell
<span class = "pagenum">205</span>
of perfumes,<a class = "tag" name = "adel_tag28" id = "adel_tag28" href

<i>longer convenient</i>, probably he’ll be shut out of doors.<a class =
"tag" name = "adel_tag29" id = "adel_tag29" href = "#adel_note29">29</a>
Has he broken open a door&mdash;it shall be replaced; has he torn any
one’s clothes&mdash;they shall be mended. Thanks to the Gods,
I&nbsp;both have means for doing this, and <i>these things</i> are not
as yet an annoyance. In fine, either desist, or else find some
arbitrator <i>between us</i>: I&nbsp;will show that in this matter you
are the most to blame.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dem.</span> Ah me! Learn to be a father from
those who are really so.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dem.</span> You, feel any anxiety?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dem.</span> I have some concern <i>for my

<p><span class = "charname">Mic.</span> I have some concern <i>for
him</i> too; but, Demea, let us each be concerned for his own
share&mdash;you for the one, and I for the other. For, to concern
yourself about both is almost the same thing as to demand him back
again, whom you intrusted to me.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dem.</span> Alas, Micio!</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Mic.</span> So it seems to me.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dem.</span> What <i>am I to say</i> to this?
If it pleases you, <i>henceforth</i>&mdash;let him spend, squander,

<p><span class = "charname">Mic.</span> Again angry, Demea?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dem.</span> Won’t you believe me? Do I
demand him back whom I have intrusted? I&nbsp;am concerned for him;
I&nbsp;am not a stranger in blood; if I do interpose&mdash;well, well,
I&nbsp;have done. You desire me to concern myself for one <i>of

<i>then</i> be in danger. On the other hand, if he were fully to confess
it, as he is in love with another woman, it would
<span class = "pagenum">218</span>

no portion; then, besides, that which was as good as a portion, <i>her

<i>resource</i> is left; if he should deny it, I&nbsp;have a ring which
he lost as evidence <i>of the truth</i>. In fine, Geta, as I am fully
conscious that no blame attaches to me, and that neither interest nor
any consideration unworthy of her or of myself has had a share in this

might in some measure have been borne with. The hour of night prompted
him; passion, wine, young blood; ’tis human nature. When he was sensible

<p>I am quite distracted in mind! for this misfortune so unexpectedly to
befall me, that I neither know what to do with myself, or how to act! My
limbs are enfeebled through
<span class = "pagenum">233</span>
fear, my faculties bewildered with apprehension; no counsel is able to
find a place within my breast. Alas! how to extricate myself from this
perplexity I know not; so strong a suspicion has taken possession of
them about me; not without some reason too: Sostrata believes that I
have purchased this Music-girl for <i>myself</i>: the old woman informed
me of that. For by accident, when she was sent for the midwife,
I&nbsp;saw her, and at once went up to her. “How is Pamphila?”
I&nbsp;inquired; “is her delivery at hand? Is it for that she is sending
for the midwife?” “Away, away, Æschinus,” cries she; “you have deceived
us long enough; already have your promises disappointed us
sufficiently.” “Ha!” said I; “pray what is the meaning of this?”
“Farewell,” <i>she cries</i>; “keep to her who is your choice.”
I&nbsp;instantly guessed what it was they suspected, but still I checked
myself, that I might not be telling that gossip any thing about my
brother, whereby it might be divulged. Now what am I to do? Shall I say
she is for my brother, a&nbsp;thing that ought by no means to be
repeated any where? However, let that pass. It is possible it might go
no further. I&nbsp;am afraid they would not believe it, so many
probabilities concur <i>against it</i>: ’twas I myself carried her off;
’twas I, my own self, that paid the money <i>for her</i>; ’twas my own
house she was carried to. This I confess has been entirely my own fault.
Ought I not to have disclosed this affair, just as it happened, to my
father? I&nbsp;might have obtained his consent to marry her. I&nbsp;have
been too negligent hitherto; henceforth, then, arouse yourself,
Æschinus. This then is the first thing; to go to them and clear myself.
I’ll approach the door. (<i>Advances to the door of <span class =

<p><span class = "charname">Mic.</span> Upon my word I believe it, for I

inconsiderate. In what city, pray, do you suppose you live? You have
debauched a virgin, whom it was not lawful for you to touch. In the
first place then that was a great offense; great, but still natural.
Others, and even men of worth, have frequently done the same. But after
it happened, pray, did you show any circumspection? Or did you use any
foresight as to what was to be done, <i>or</i> how it was to be done? If
you were ashamed to tell me of it, by what means was I to come to know
it? While you were at a loss upon these points, ten months have been
lost. So far indeed as lay in your power, you have periled both yourself
<i>and</i> this poor <i>girl</i>, and the child. What did you
imagine&mdash;that the Gods would set these matters to rights for you
while you were asleep, and that she would be brought home to your
chamber without any exertions of your own? I&nbsp;would not have you to
be equally negligent in other affairs. Be of good heart, you shall have
her for your wife.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Mic.</span> Listen to a few words, unless it
is disagreeable, Demea. In the first place, if the extravagance your
sons are guilty of distresses you, pray do reason with yourself. You
formerly brought up the two suitably to your circumstances, thinking
that your own property would have to suffice for them both; and, of
course, you then thought that I should marry. Adhere to that same old
rule <i>of yours</i>,&mdash;save, scrape together, <i>and</i> be thrifty
<i>for them</i>; take care to leave them as much as possible, and
<i>take</i> that credit to yourself: my fortune, which has come to them
beyond their expectation, allow them to enjoy; of <i>your</i> captial
there will be no diminution; what comes from this quarter, set it
<i>all</i> down as so much gain. If you think proper impartially to
consider these matters in your mind, Demea, you will save me and
yourself, and them, <i>considerable</i> uneasiness.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dem.</span> I don’t speak about the expense;
their morals&mdash;</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Mic.</span> Hold; I understand you; that

to.<a class = "tag" name = "adel_tag85" id = "adel_tag85" href =
"#adel_note85">85</a> There are in men, Demea, many signs from which a
conjecture is easily formed; <i>so that</i> when two persons do the same
thing, you may often say, this one may be allowed to do it with
impunity, the other may not; not that the thing <i>itself</i> is
different, but that he is who does it. I&nbsp;see <i>signs</i> in them,
so as to feel confident that they will turn out as we wish. I&nbsp;see
that they have good sense and understanding, that they have modesty upon
occasion, <i>and</i> are affectionate to each other; you may infer that
their bent and disposition is of a pliant nature; at any time you like
you may reclaim them. But still, you may be apprehensive that they will
be somewhat too apt to neglect their interests. O&nbsp;my <i>dear</i>
Demea, in all other things we grow wiser with age; this sole vice does
old age bring upon men: we are all more solicitous about our own
interests than we need be; and in this respect age will make them sharp
enough.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dem.</span> Never was there any person of
ever such well-trained habits of life, but that experience, age,
<i>and</i> custom are always bringing <i>him</i> something new,
<i>or</i> suggesting something; so much so, that what you believe you
know you don’t know, and what you have fancied of first importance to
you, on making trial you reject; and this is my case at present: for the
rigid life I have hitherto led, my race nearly run, I&nbsp;<i>now</i>
renounce. Why so?&mdash;I have found, by experience, that there is
nothing better for a man than an easy temper and complacency. That this
is the truth, it is easy for any one to understand on comparing me with
my brother. He has always spent his life in ease <i>and</i> gayety;
mild, gentle, offensive to no one, having a smile for all, he has lived
for himself, <i>and</i> has spent his money for himself; all men speak
well of him, <i>all</i> love him. I, <i>again</i>, a&nbsp;rustic,
a&nbsp;rigid, cross, self-denying, morose and thrifty person, married a
wife; what misery I entailed in consequence! Sons were born&mdash;a
fresh care. And just look, while I have been studying to do as much as
possible for them, I&nbsp;have worn out my life and years in saving;
now, in the decline of my days, the return I get from them for my pains
<i>is</i> their dislike. He, on the other hand, without
<span class = "pagenum">246</span>
any trouble on his part, enjoys a father’s comforts; they love him; me
they shun; him they trust with all their secrets, are fond of him, are
<i>always</i> with him. I&nbsp;am forsaken; they wish him to live; but
my death, forsooth, they are longing for. Thus, after bringing them up
with all possible pains, at a trifling cost he has made them his own;
thus I bear all the misery, he enjoys the pleasure. Well, then,
henceforward let us try, on the other hand, whether I can’t speak kindly
and act complaisantly, as he challenges me to it: I&nbsp;also want
myself to be loved and highly valued by my friends. If that is to be
effected by giving and indulging, I&nbsp;will not be behind him. If our
means fail, that least concerns me, as I am the eldest.<a class = "tag"

I now adopt that proverb which you, Micio, a&nbsp;short time ago

you in every thing, just <i>or</i> unjust, I&nbsp;have done: squander,

<i>Of Æmilius Paulus</i>)&mdash;This Play (from the Greek <span class =
"greek" title = "Adelphoi,">Ἀδελφοὶ</span> “The Brothers”) was performed
at the Funeral Games of Lucius Æmilius Paulus, who was surnamed
Macedonicus, from having gained a victory over Perseus, King of Macedon.
He was so poor at the time of his decease, that they were obliged to
sell his estate in order to pay his widow her dower. The Q. Fabius
Maximus and P. Cornelius Africanus here mentioned were not, as some have
thought, the Curale Ædiles, but two sons of Æmilius Paulus, who had
taken the surnames of the families into which they had been adopted.</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note15" id = "adel_note15" href =
"#adel_tag15">15.</a>
<i>Sarranian flutes</i>)&mdash;The “Sarranian” or “Tyrian” pipes, or
flutes, are supposed to have been of a quick and mirthful tone; Madame
Dacier has consequently with much justice suggested that the
representation being on the occasion of a funeral, the title has not
come down to us in a complete form, and that it was performed with the
Lydian, or grave, solemn pipe, alternately with the Tyrian. This opinion
is also strengthened by the fact that Donatus expressly says that it was
performed to the music of Lydian flutes.</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note16" id = "adel_note16" href =
"#adel_tag16">16.</a>
<i>Being Consuls</i>)&mdash;L. Anicius Gallus and M. Cornelius Cethegus

<p><a name = "adel_note17" id = "adel_note17" href =

<i>Synapothnescontes</i>)&mdash;Ver. 6. Signifying “persons dying
together.” The “Commorientes” of Plautus is lost. It has been doubted by
some, despite these words of Terence, if Plautus ever did write such a
Play.</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note18" id = "adel_note18" href =
"#adel_tag18">18.</a>
<i>Of Diphilus</i>)&mdash;Ver. 6. Diphilus was a Greek Poet,
contemporary with Menander.</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note19" id = "adel_note19" href =
"#adel_tag19">19.</a>
<i>In war, in peace, in private business</i>)&mdash;Ver. 20. According
to Donatus, by the words “in bello,” Terence is supposed to refer to his
friend and patron Scipio; by “in otio,” to Furius Publius; and in the
words “in negotio” to Lælius, who was famed for his wisdom.</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note20" id = "adel_note20" href =
"#adel_tag20">20.</a>
<i>The old men</i>)&mdash;Ver. 23. This is similar to the words in the
Prologue to the Trinummus of Plautus, l. 16: “But expect nothing about
the plot of this Play; the old men who will come hither will disclose
the matter to you.”</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note21" id = "adel_note21" href =
"#adel_tag21">21.</a>
<i>To fetch him</i>)&mdash;Ver. 24. “Advorsum ierant.” On the duties of
the “adversitores,” see the Notes to Bohn’s Translation of Plautus.</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note22" id = "adel_note22" href =
"#adel_tag22">22.</a>
<i>Either have taken cold</i>)&mdash;Ver. 36. Westerhovius observes that
this passage seems to be taken from one in the Miles Gloriosus of
Plautus, l. 721, <i>et seq.</i>: “Troth, if I had had them, enough
anxiety should I have had from my children; I&nbsp;should have been
everlastingly adelphiented in mind: but if perchance one had had a
fever, I&nbsp;think I should have died. Or if one in liquor had tumbled
any where from his horse, I&nbsp;should have been afraid that he had
broken his legs or neck on that occasion.” It may be remarked that there
is a great resemblance between the characters of Micio here and
Periplecomenus in the Miles Gloriosus.</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note23" id = "adel_note23" href =
"#adel_tag23">23.</a>
<i>To see you well</i>)&mdash;Ver. 81. Cooke remarks, that though there
are several fine passages in this speech, and good observations on human
life, yet it is too long a soliloquy.</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note24" id = "adel_note24" href =
"#adel_tag24">24.</a>
<i>I was looking for</i>)&mdash;Ver. 81. Donatus observes that the Poet
has in this place improved upon Menander, in representing Demea as more
ready to wrangle with his brother than to return his compliments.</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note25" id = "adel_note25" href =
"#adel_tag25">25.</a>
<i>Such a son as Æschinus</i>)&mdash;Ver. 82. The passage pretty clearly
means by “ubi nobis Æschinus sit,” “when I’ve got such a son as
Æschinus.” Madame Dacier, however, would translate it: “Ask
me&mdash;you, in whose house Æschinus is?” thus accusing him of
harboring Æschinus; a&nbsp;very forced construction, however.</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note26" id = "adel_note26" href =
"#adel_tag26">26.</a>
<i>Broken open a door</i>)&mdash;Ver. 88. The works of Ovid and Plautus
show that it was no uncommon thing for riotous young men to break open
doors; Ovid even suggests to the lover the expediency of getting into
the house through the windows.</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note27" id = "adel_note27" href =
"#adel_tag27">27.</a>
<i>Does he feast</i>)&mdash;Ver. 117. Colman has the following
observation here: “The mild character of Micio is contrasted by Cicero
to that of a furious, savage, severe father, as drawn by the famous
Comic Poet, Caecilius. Both writers are quoted in the Oration for
Caelias, in the composition of which it is plain that the orator kept
his eye pretty closely on our Poet. The passages from Caecilius contain
all that vehemence and severity, which, as Horace tells us, was
accounted the common character of the style of that author.”</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note28" id = "adel_note28" href =
"#adel_tag28">28.</a>
<i>Smell of perfumes</i>)&mdash;Ver. 117. For an account of the
“unguenta,” or perfumes in use among the ancients, see the Notes to
Bohn’s translation of Plautus.</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note29" id = "adel_note29" href =
"#adel_tag29">29.</a>
<i>Will be shut out of doors</i>)&mdash;Ver. 119. No doubt by his
mistress when she has drained him of his money, and not by Micio
himself, as Colman says he was once led to imagine.</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note30" id = "adel_note30" href =
"#adel_tag30">30.</a>
<i>These things are</i>)&mdash;Ver. 141. Donatus observes here, that
Terence seems inclined to favor the part of mild fathers. He represents
Micio as appalled at his adopted son’s irregularities, lest if he should
appear wholly unmoved, he should seem to be corrupting him, rather than
to be treating him with only a proper degree of indulgence.</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note31" id = "adel_note31" href =
"#adel_tag31">31.</a>
<i>Wished to take a wife</i>)&mdash;Ver. 151. Donatus remarks here, that
the art of Terence in preparing his incidents is wonderful. He contrives
that even ignorant persons shall open the plot, as in the present
instance, where we understand that Aeschinus has mentioned to Micio his
intention of taking a wife, though he has not entered into particulars.
This naturally leads us to the ensuing parts of the Play, without
forestalling any of the circumstances.</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note32" id = "adel_note32" href =
"#adel_tag32">32.</a>
<i>I am a Procurer</i>)&mdash;Ver. 161. He says this aloud, and with
emphasis, relying upon the laws which were enacted at Athens in favor of
the “lenones,” whose occupation brought great profits to the state, from
their extensive trading in slaves. It was forbidden to maltreat them,
under pain of being disinherited.</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note33" id = "adel_note33" href =
"#adel_tag33">33.</a>
<i>I am a Procurer</i>)&mdash;Ver. 188. Westerhovius supposes this part
to be a translation from the works of Diphilus.</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note34" id = "adel_note34" href =
"#adel_tag34">34.</a>
<i>By action of freedom</i>)&mdash;Ver. 194. “Asserere liberati causa,”
was to assert the freedom of a person, with a determination to maintain
it at law. The “assertor” laid hands upon the person, declaring that he
or she was free; and till the cause was tried, the person whose freedom
was claimed, remained in the hands of the “assertor.”</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note35" id = "adel_note35" href =
"#adel_tag35">35.</a>
<i>Till I return</i>)&mdash;Ver. 196. Colman has a curious remark here:
“I do not remember, in the whole circle of modern comedy, a&nbsp;more
natural picture of the elegant ease and indifference of a fine
gentleman, than that exhibited in this Scene in the character of
Æschinus.”</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note36" id = "adel_note36" href =
"#adel_tag36">36.</a>
<i>I have sold her</i>)&mdash;Ver. 204. He means, that if he only names
a price, Æschinus will suborn witnesses to say that he has agreed to
sell her, in which case Æschinus will carry her off with impunity, and
the laws will not allow him to recover her; as it will then be an
ordinary debt, and he will be put off with all the common excuses used
by debtors.</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note37" id = "adel_note37" href =
"#adel_tag37">37.</a>
<i>On more unequal terms</i>)&mdash;Ver. 212. “Certationem comparatam.”
This was a term taken from the combats of gladiators, where it was usual
to choose as combatants such as seemed most nearly a match for each
other.</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note38" id = "adel_note38" href =
"#adel_tag38">38.</a>
<i>If you had parted with ever so little</i>)&mdash;Ver. 217. This
passage is probably alluded to by Cicero, in his work, De Officiis B.
ii. c. 18: “For it is not only liberal sometimes to give up a little of
one’s rights, but it is also profitable.”</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note39" id = "adel_note39" href =
"#adel_tag39">39.</a>
<i>In the very joint</i>)&mdash;Ver. 229. “Ut in ipso articulo
oppressit.” Colman translates this, “Nick’d me to a hair.”</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note40" id = "adel_note40" href =
"#adel_tag40">40.</a>
<i>To take to Cyprus</i>)&mdash;Ver. 230. He alludes to a famous
slave-market held in the Isle of Cyprus, whither merchants carried
slaves for sale, after buying them up in all parts of Greece.</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note41" id = "adel_note41" href =
"#adel_tag41">41.</a>
<i>Have you by this reckoned</i>)&mdash;Ver. 236. “Jamne enumerasti id
quod ad te rediturum putes?” Colman renders this, “Well, have you
calculated what’s your due?” referring to the value of the Music-girl
that has been taken away from him; and thinks that the following
conversation between Sannio and Syrus supports that construction. Madame
Dacier puts another sense on the words, and understands them as alluding
to Sannio’s calculation of his expected profits at Cyprus.</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note42" id = "adel_note42" href =

<i>Scrape together ten minæ</i>)&mdash;Ver. 242. Donatus remarks, that
Syrus knows very well that Æschinus is ready to pay the whole, but
offers Sannio half, that he may be glad to take the bare principal, and
think himself well off into the bargain.</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note43" id = "adel_note43" href =

<i>He’s looking for me</i>)&mdash;Ver. 265. Donatus remarks upon the
readiness with which Sannio takes the appellation of “sacrilegus,” as
adapted to no other person than himself.</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note44" id = "adel_note44" href =
"#adel_tag44">44.</a>
<i>Flying the country</i>)&mdash;Ver. 275. Donatus tells us, that in
Menander the young man was on the point of killing himself. Terence has
here softened it into leaving the country. Colman remarks: “We know that
the circumstance of carrying off the Music-girl was borrowed from
Diphilus; yet it is plain from Donatus that there was also an intrigue
by Ctesipho in the Play of Menander; which gives another proof of the
manner in which Terence used the Greek Comedies.”</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note45" id = "adel_note45" href =

<i>He is in haste for Cyprus</i>)&mdash;Ver. 278. Donatus remarks that
this is a piece of malice on the part of Syrus, for the purpose of
teasing Sannio.</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note47" id = "adel_note47" href =
"#adel_tag47">47.</a>
<i>Leave me alone</i>)&mdash;Ver. 321. Quoting from Madame Dacier,
Colman has this remark here: “Geta’s reply is founded on a frolicsome
but ill-natured custom which prevailed in Greece&mdash;to stop the
slaves in the streets, and designedly keep them in chat, so that they
might be lashed when they came home for staying out so long.”</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note48" id = "adel_note48" href =

<i>On his father’s knees</i>)&mdash;Ver. 333. It was a prevalent custom
with the Greeks to place the newly-born child upon the knee of its
grandfather.</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note49" id = "adel_note49" href =
"#adel_tag49">49.</a>
<i>It shall be boned</i>)&mdash;Ver. 378. The operation of boning
conger-eels is often mentioned in Plautus, from whom we learn that they
were best when eaten in that state, and cold.</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note50" id = "adel_note50" href =
"#adel_tag50">50.</a>
<i>Serve somewhere or other as a soldier</i>)&mdash;Ver. 385. See a
similar passage in the Trinummus of Plautus, l. 722, whence it appears
that it was the practice for young men of ruined fortunes to go and
offer their services as mercenaries to some of the neighboring
potentates. Many of the ten thousand who fought for the younger Cyrus at
the battle of Cunaxa, and were led back under the command of Xenophon,
were, doubtless, of this class.</p>

<i>Of our tribe</i>)&mdash;Ver. 439. Solon divided the Athenians into
ten tribes, which he named after ten of the ancient heroes: Erectheis,
Ægeis, Pandionis, Leontis, Acamantis, Œneis, Cecrops, Hippothoontis,
Æantis, and Antiochis. These tribes were each divided into ten Demi.</p>

<i>Upon this matter I’ll follow</i>)&mdash;Ver. 500. “Is, quod mihi de
hae re dederat consilium, id sequar.” Coleman has the following Note on
this passage: “Madame Dacier rejects this line, because it is also to be
found in the Phormio. But it is no uncommon thing with our author to use
the same expression or verse for different places, especially on
familiar occasions. There is no impropriety in it here, and the
foregoing hemistich is rather lame without it. The propriety of
consulting Micio, or Demea’s present ill-humor with him, are of no
consequence. The old man is surprised at Hegio’s story, does not know
what to do or say, and means to evade giving a positive answer, by
saying that he would consult his brother.”</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note59" id = "adel_note59" href =

<i>Go back now</i>)&mdash;Ver. 506. “Redite.” Demea most probably uses
this word, because Hegio has come back to him to repeat the last words
for the sake of greater emphasis.</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note60" id = "adel_note60" href =
"#adel_tag60">60.</a>
<i>Be of good heart</i>)&mdash;Ver. 512. Colman has the following Note
here: “Donatus tells us, that in some old copies this whole Scene was
wanting. Guyetus therefore entirely rejects it. I&nbsp;have not ventured
to take that liberty; but must confess that it appears to me, if not
supposititious, at least cold and superfluous, and the substance of it
had better been supposed to have passed between Hegio and Sostrata
within.”</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note61" id = "adel_note61" href =

<i>At this very moment</i>)&mdash;Ver. 519. It is very doubtful whether
the words “cum maxime” mean to signify exactly “at this moment,” or are
intended to signify the intensity with which Demea is laboring.</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note62" id = "adel_note62" href =
"#adel_tag62">62.</a>
<i>Any thing still better than that</i>)&mdash;Ver. 522. Lemaire
suggests that by these words Syrus intends to imply that he should not
care if Demea were never to arise from his bed, but were to die there.
Ctesipho, only taking him heartily to second his own wishes for the old
man’s absence, answers affirmatively “ita,” “by all means,” “exactly
so.”</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note63" id = "adel_note63" href =

<i>So much the worse</i>)&mdash;Ver. 529. Schmieder observes that “tanto
nequior” might have two meanings,&mdash;“so much the worse <i>for
us</i>,” or, as the spectators might understand it, “so much the more
worthless you.”</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note64" id = "adel_note64" href =

<i>The wolf in the fable</i>)&mdash;Ver. 538. This was a proverbial
expression, tantamount to our saying, “Talk of the devil, he’s sure to
appear.” Servius, in his Commentary on the Ninth Eclogue of Virgil, says
that the saying arose from the common belief that the person whom a wolf
sets his eyes upon is deprived of his voice, and thence came to be
applied to a person who, coming upon others in the act of talking about
him, necessarily put a stop to their conversation. Cooke says, in
reference to this passage, “This certainly alludes to a Fable of Æsop’s,
of the Wolf, the Fox, and the Ape: which is translated by Phædrus, and
is the tenth of his First Book.” It is much more certain that Cooke is
mistaken here, and that the fable of the arbitration of the Ape between
the Wolf and the Fox has nothing to do with this passage. If it alludes
to any fable (which from the expression itself is not at all unlikely),
it is more likely to be that where the Nurse threatens that the wolf
shall take the naughty Child, on which he makes his appearance, but is
disappointed in his expectations, or else that of the Shepherd-boy and
the Wolf. See the Stichus of Plautus, l.&nbsp;57, where the same
expression occurs.</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note65" id = "adel_note65" href =
"#adel_tag65">65.</a>
<i>Met a day-laborer</i>)&mdash;Ver. 542. Donatus remarks that the Poet
artfully contrives to detain Demea in town, his presence being necessary
in the latter part of the Play.</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note66" id = "adel_note66" href =
"#adel_tag66">66.</a>
<i>With her in some cupboard</i>)&mdash;Ver. 553. Donatus observes that
the young man was silly in this, for if discovered to be there he would
be sure to be caught. His object, however, for going there would be that
he might not be discovered.</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note67" id = "adel_note67" href =

<i>Take me to be in my senses</i>)&mdash;Ver. 580. “Censen hominem me

take me to be a person in my common senses?”</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note68" id = "adel_note68" href =
"#adel_tag68">68.</a>
<i>Street on the left hand</i>)&mdash;Ver. 583. Theobald, in his edition
of Shakspeare, observes that the direction given by Lancelot in the
Merchant of Venice seems to be copied from that given here by Syrus:
“Turn up on your right hand at the next turning, but at the next turning
of all on your left; marry, at the very next turning of no hand, but
turn down indirectly to the Jew’s house.”</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note69" id = "adel_note69" href =
"#adel_tag69">69.</a>
<i>Come to the city gate</i>)&mdash;Ver. 584. From this we discover that
Demea is being sent to the very extremity of the town, as Donatus
informs us that ponds of water were always close to the gates of towns,
for the purpose of watering the beasts of burden, and of having a supply
at hand in case the enemy should set fire to the city gates.</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note70" id = "adel_note70" href =
"#adel_tag70">70.</a>
<i>The open air</i>)&mdash;Ver. 586. Donatus remarks that it was usual
for the Greeks to sit and drink in the sun; and that Syrus being
suddenly asked this question shows his presence of mind by giving this
circumstantial answer, that he may the better impose upon Demea. The
couches used on such occasions may be presumed to have required stout
legs, and to be made of hard wood, such as oak, to prevent them from
splitting. Two instances of couches being used for carousing in the open
air will be found in the last Scenes of the Asinaria and Stichus of
Plautus.</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note71" id = "adel_note71" href =

<i>You skeleton</i>)&mdash;Ver. 588. “Silicernium.” This was said to be
the name of a funeral entertainment or dish of meats offered up to the
“umbræ” or “manes,” in silence. The word is also said to have been
applied to an old man from his stooping postures, “silices cernit,” “he
looks at the stones.”</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note72" id = "adel_note72" href =

“quite” or “altogether.”</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note73" id = "adel_note73" href =
"#adel_tag73">73.</a>
<i>Sipping my cups</i>)&mdash;Ver. 592. As to the “cyathi” and cups of
the ancients, see the last Scene of the Stichus of Plautus, which is a
perfect specimen of a carousal among the lower classes in ancient times.
See also the last Scene of the Asinaria. The slaves generally appear to
have taken part in the entertainments with their young masters.</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note74" id = "adel_note74" href =

<i>Are suspicious</i>)&mdash;Ver. 606. These lines are supposed to be
founded on some verses of Menander which are still extant.</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note75" id = "adel_note75" href =
"#adel_tag75">75.</a>
<i>Obliges him to marry her</i>)&mdash;Ver. 655. It appears to have been
a law given by Solon to the Athenians that the next male relative of
suitable age should marry a female orphan himself, or find her a
suitable portion. Madame Dacier suggests that the custom was derived
from the Phœnicians, who had received it from the Jews, and quotes the
Book of Numbers, xxxvi. 8. This law forms the basis of the plot of the
Phormio.</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note76" id = "adel_note76" href =

the coast of Asia Minor.</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note77" id = "adel_note77" href =
"#adel_tag77">77.</a>
<i>Who betrothed her?</i>)&mdash;Ver. 673. Donatus observes that these
questions, which enumerate all the proofs requisite for a marriage, are
an indirect and very delicate reproof of Æschinus for the irregular and
clandestine nature of his proceedings.</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note78" id = "adel_note78" href =
"#adel_tag78">78.</a>
<i>Propitious to you</i>)&mdash;Ver. 707. Donatus remarks that there is
great delicacy in this compliment of Æschinus to Micio, which, though
made in his presence, does not bear the semblance of flattery. Madame
Dacier thinks that Terence here alludes to a line of Hesiod, which says
that it is the duty of the aged to pray. Colman suggests that the
passage is borrowed from some lines of Menander still in existence.</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note79" id = "adel_note79" href =

<i>Certainly I had rather</i>)&mdash;Ver. 730. He pauses after “quidem,”

not been so.</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note80" id = "adel_note80" href =
"#adel_tag80">80.</a>
<i>Playing with dice</i>)&mdash;Ver. 742. The “tesseræ” of the ancients
were cubes, or what we call “dice;” while the “tali” were in imitation
of the knuckle-bones of animals, and were marked on four sides only. For
some account of the mode of playing with the “tali,” see the last Scene
of the Asinaria, and the Curculio of Plautus, l. 257-9. Madame Dacier
suggests that Menander may possibly have borrowed this passage from the
Republic of Plato, B.&nbsp;X., where he says, “We should take counsel
from accidents, and, as in a game at dice, act according to what has
fallen, in the manner which reason tells us to be the best.”</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note81" id = "adel_note81" href =
"#adel_tag81">81.</a>
<i>Hold of the rope</i>)&mdash;Ver. 755. “Restim ductans saltabis.”
Donatus and Madame Dacier think that this is only a figurative
expression for a dance in which all joined hands; according to some,
however, a&nbsp;dance is alluded to where the person who led off drew a
rope or cord after him, which the rest of the company took hold of as
they danced; which was invented in resemblance of the manner in which
the wooden horse was dragged by ropes into the city of Troy.</p>

<i>Have done your duty</i>)&mdash;Ver. 767. His duty of providing the
viands and drink for the entertainment. So Ergasilus says in the Captivi
of Plautus, l. 912, “Now I will go off to my government (præfecturam),
to give laws to the bacon.”</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note84" id = "adel_note84" href =
"#adel_tag84">84.</a>
<i>I must assist him</i>)&mdash;Ver. 795. Colman remarks on this
passage: “The character of Micio appears extremely amiable through the
first four Acts of this Comedy, and his behavior is in many respects
worthy of imitation; but his conduct in conniving at the irregularities
of Ctesipho, and even assisting him to support them, is certainly
reprehensible. Perhaps the Poet threw this shade over his virtues on
purpose to show that mildness and good-humor might be carried to
excess.”</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note85" id = "adel_note85" href =
"#adel_tag85">85.</a>
<i>That point I was coming to</i>)&mdash;Ver. 824. Colman observes here:
“Madame Dacier makes an observation on this speech, something like that
of Donatus on one of Micio’s above; and says that Micio, being hard put
to it by the real circumstances of the case, thinks to confound Demea by
a nonsensical gallimatia. I&nbsp;can not be of the ingenious lady’s
opinion on this matter, for I think a more sensible speech could not be
made, nor a better plea offered in favor of the young men, than that of
Micio in the present instance.”</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note90" id = "adel_note90" href =

<i>The music-girl</i>)&mdash;Ver. 908. “Tibicinæ,” or music-girls,

Megadorus hires the music-girls on his intended marriage with the
daughter of Euclio.</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note91" id = "adel_note91" href =
"#adel_tag91">91.</a>
<i>The crowds, the torches</i>)&mdash;Ver. 910. See the Casina of
Plautus, Act IV., Scenes 3 and&nbsp;4, for some account of the marriage
ceremonial. The torches, music-girls, processions, and hymeneal song,
generally accompanied a wedding, but from the present passage we may
conclude that they were not considered absolutely necessary.</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note92" id = "adel_note92" href =

Plautus, l.&nbsp;301.</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note93" id = "adel_note93" href =
"#adel_tag93">93.</a>
<i>Bid that Babylonian</i>)&mdash;Ver. 918. This passage has much
puzzled the Commentators; but it seems most probable that it is said
aside, and that in consequence of his profuseness he calls his brother a
Babylonian, (just as we call a wealthy man a nabob,) and says, “Well,
let him, with all my heart, be paying twenty minæ (between £70 and £80)
for music-girl.”</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note94" id = "adel_note94" href =

<p><a name = "adel_note96" id = "adel_note96" href =
"#adel_tag96">96.</a>
<i>Really, this is downright force</i>)&mdash;Ver. 946. “Vis est hæc
quidem.” The same expression occurs in the Captivi of Plautus, l. 755.
The expression seemed to be a common one with the Romans. According to
Suetonius, Julius Cæsar used it when attacked by his murderers in the
senate-house. On Tullius Cimber seizing hold of his garments, he
exclaimed, “Ita quidem vis est!”&mdash;“Why, really, this is
violence!”</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note97" id = "adel_note97" href =

<i>This seems to me</i>)&mdash;Ver. 947. Donatus informs us that in
Menander’s Play, the old man did not make any resistance whatever to the
match thus patched up for him. Colman has the following observation on
this fact: “It is surprising that none of the critics on this passage
have taken notice of this observation of Donatus, especially as our loss
of Menander makes it rather curious. It is plain that Terence in the
plan of his last Act followed Menander; but though he has adopted the
absurdity of marrying Micio to the old lady, yet we learn from Donatus
that his judgment rather revolted at this circumstance, and he improved
on his original by making Micio express a repugnance to such a match,
which it seems he did not in the Play of Menander.”</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note98" id = "adel_note98" href =

2, l. 65.</p>

<p><a name = "adel_note101" id = "adel_note101" href =
"#adel_tag101">101.</a>
<i>My wife, Phrygia</i>)&mdash;Ver. 977. The so-called marriage, or
rather cohabitation, of the Roman slaves will be found treated upon in
the Notes to Plautus. Syrus calls Phrygia his wife on anticipation that
she will become a free woman.</p>

in this sanction as a parent would be sensible of at the present
day.</p>
