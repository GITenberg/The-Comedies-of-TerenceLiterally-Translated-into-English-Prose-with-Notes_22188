<hr class = "small">

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Pamphilus</span>, the son of Laches by his
wife Sostrata, being at the time enamored of Bacchis, a&nbsp;Courtesan,
chances, one night, in a drunken fit, to debauch Philumena, the daughter
of Phidippus and Myrrhina. In the struggle he takes a ring from her,
which he gives to Bacchis. Some time afterward, at his father’s express
desire, he consents to marry. By chance the young woman whom he has
ravished is given to him as a wife, to the great joy of her mother, who
alone is aware of her misfortune, and hopes that her disgrace may be
thereby concealed. It, however, happens otherwise; for Pamphilus, still
retaining his passion for Bacchis, refuses for some time to cohabit with
her. Bacchis, however, now rejects the advances of Pamphilus, who by
degrees becomes weaned from his affection for her, and grows attached to
his wife, whom he has hitherto disliked. Meantime, however, he is
suddenly called away from home. During his absence, Philumena, finding
herself pregnant in consequence of her misfortune before her marriage,
fearing detection, especially avoids the company of her mother-in-law.
At length she makes an excuse for returning to the home of her own
parents, where she remains. Sostrata thereupon sends for her, but is
answered that she is ill, on which she goes to see her, but is refused
admittance to the house. On hearing of this, Laches blames his wife as
being the cause of this estrangement. Pamphilus now returns, and it so
happens that, on the day of his arrival, Philumena is brought to bed of
a child. Impatient to see her, Pamphilus rushes into her room, and to
his great distress finds that this is the case. Myrrhina thereupon
entreats him to keep the matter secret, and begs him, if he refuses to
receive her daughter back again, at least not to ruin her reputation by
divulging it. As he now declines either to take back his wife or give
his reason for so doing, Laches suspects that he is still enamored of
Bacchis, and accordingly sends for her, and expostulates with her. She,
however, exonerates herself; on which the old man, supposing that
Philumena and her mother are equally ignorant with himself as to his
son’s motives, begs her to call on them and remove their suspicions.
While she is conversing with them, they recognize the ring upon her
finger which Pamphilus had formerly taken from Philumena. By means of
this it is discovered that Pamphilus himself is the person who has
ravished Philumena; on which, overjoyed, he immediately takes home his
wife and son.</p>

<h5>THE SUMMARY OF C. SULPITIUS APOLLINARIS.</h5>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Pamphilus</span> has married Philumena, to
whom, when a virgin, he formerly, not knowing who she was, offered
violence; and whose ring which he took off by force, he gave to his
mistress, Bacchis, a&nbsp;Courtesan. Afterward he sets out for Imbros,
not having touched his bride. Having become pregnant, her mother brings
her over to her own house, as though sick, that her mother-in-law may
not know it. Pamphilus returns; detects her being delivered; conceals
it; but determines not to take back his wife. His father imputes
<i>this</i> to his passion for Bacchis. While Bacchis is exculpating
herself, Myrrhina, the mother of the injured girl, by chance recognizes
the ring. Pamphilus takes back his wife, together with his son.</p>

rope-dancing. It is now offered as though entirely a new Play; and he

<p><span class = "smallcaps">I come</span> to you as an envoy from the
Poet, in the character of prologue-speaker; allow me to be a successful
pleader, that in my old age I may enjoy the same privilege that I
enjoyed when a, younger man, when I caused new Plays, that had been
<i>once</i> rejected, to come into favor; so that his writings might not
die with the Poet. Among them, as to those of Cæcilius,<a class = "tag"
name = "hec_tag19" id = "hec_tag19" href = "#hec_note19">19</a> which I
first studied when new; in some of which I was rejected; in some I kept
my ground with difficulty. As I knew that the fortune of the stage was
varying, where the hopes were uncertain, I&nbsp;submitted to certain
toil. Those I zealously attempted to perform, that from the same
<i>writer</i> I might learn new ones, <i>and</i> not discourage him from
his pursuits. I&nbsp;caused them to be represented. When seen, they
pleased. Thus did I restore the Poet to his place, who was now almost
weaned, through the malevolence of his adversaries, from his pursuits
and labors, and from the dramatic art. But if I had at that period
slighted the writer, and had wished to use my endeavors
<span class = "pagenum">259</span>
in discouraging him, so that he might live a life of idleness rather
than of study, I&nbsp;might have easily discouraged him from writing
others. Now, for my sake, hear with unbiased minds what it is I ask.
I&nbsp;again bring before you the Hecyra, which I have never been
allowed to act <i>before you</i> in silence; such misfortunes have so
overwhelmed it. These misfortunes your intelligence will allay, if it is
a seconder of our exertions. The first time, when I began to act this
<i>Play</i>, the vauntings of boxers,<a class = "tag" name = "hec_tag20"
id = "hec_tag20" href = "#hec_note20">20</a> the expectation of a
rope-dancer,<a class = "tag" name = "hec_tag21" id = "hec_tag21" href =
"#hec_note21">21</a> added to which, the throng of followers, the noise,
the clamor of the women, caused me to retire from your presence before
the time. In this new Play, I&nbsp;attempted to follow the old custom
<i>of mine</i>,<a class = "tag" name = "hec_tag22" id = "hec_tag22" href
= "#hec_note22">22</a> of making a fresh trial; I&nbsp;brought it on
again. In the first Act I pleased; when in the mean time a rumor spread
that gladiators were about to be exhibited; the populace flock together,
make a tumult, clamor aloud, <i>and</i> fight for their places:<a class
= "tag" name = "hec_tag23" id = "hec_tag23" href = "#hec_note23">23</a>
meantime, I&nbsp;was unable to maintain my place. Now there is no
confusion: there is attention and silence&mdash;an opportunity of acting
<i>my Play</i> has been granted me; to yourselves is given the power of
gracing the scenic festival.<a class = "tag" name = "hec_tag24" id =

art to sink into the hands of a few; let your authority prove a seconder

skill, and have come to this conclusion, that it is the greatest gain in
the highest possible degree to contribute to your entertainment; allow
me to obtain this of you, that him who has intrusted his labors to my
protection, and himself to your integrity,&mdash;that him,
I&nbsp;<i>say</i>, the malicious may not maliciously deride, beset <i>by

should be asking for me, do you say that I have just gone to the harbor
to inquire about the arrival of Pamphilus. Do you hear what I say,
Scirtus? If he asks for me, then you are to say <i>so</i>; if he does
not, <i>why</i>, say nothing at all; so that at another time I may be
able to employ that excuse as a new one. (<i>Comes forward, and looking

come <i>here</i>? (<i>Accosting her.</i>) Philotis heartily
good-morrow.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Par.</span> I’faith, Syra, the same to you.
Philotis, tell me, where have you been enjoying yourself so long?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phil.</span> For my part, indeed, I have
been far from enjoying myself, in leaving this place for Corinth with a
most brutal captain; for two whole years, there, had I to put up with
him to my sorrow.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Par.</span> I’troth, I fancy that regret for
Athens full oft possessed
<span class = "pagenum">262</span>
you, and that you thought but poorly of your foresight.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phil.</span> It can not be expressed how
impatient I was to return hither, get rid of the captain, and see
yourselves here, that after our old fashion I might at my ease enjoy the
merry-makings among you; for there it was not allowed <i>me</i> to
speak, except at <i>the moment</i> prescribed, <i>and</i> on such
subjects as he chose.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Par.</span> (<i>sarcastically.</i>) I don’t
think it was gallant in the captain to place a restraint on your
tongue.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phil.</span> But what is this piece of
business that Bacchis has just now been telling me in-doors here?
(<i>pointing to her house.</i>) <i>A thing</i> I never supposed would
come to pass, that he, in her lifetime, could possibly prevail upon his
feelings to take a wife.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Par.</span> To take, indeed!</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phil.</span> Why, look you, has he not taken
one?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Par.</span> He has; but I doubt whether this
match will be lasting.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phil.</span> May the Gods and Goddesses
grant it so, if it is for the advantage of Bacchis. But why am I to
believe it is so? Tell me, Parmeno.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Par.</span> There is no need for its being

<p><span class = "charname">Phil.</span> For fear, I suppose, it may be

that I may spread it abroad, but that, in silence, I&nbsp;may rejoice
within myself.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Par.</span> You’ll never speak me so fairly,
that I shall trust my back to your discretion.</p>

Parmeno;<a class = "tag" name = "hec_tag27" id = "hec_tag27" href =

me this, than I to learn what I’m inquiring about.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Par.</span> (<i>to himself.</i>) She tells
the truth there; and that is my greatest failing. (<i>To <span class =

keep it a secret, I’ll tell you.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">263</span>
<p><span class = "charname">Phil.</span> You are <i>now</i> returning to
your <i>natural</i> disposition. I&nbsp;give you my word; say on.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Par.</span> Listen.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phil.</span> I’m all attention.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Par.</span> Pamphilus was in the height of
his passion for Bacchis here, when his father began to importune him to
take a wife, and to urge those points which are usual with all fathers,
that he <i>himself</i> was <i>now</i> in years, and that he was his only
son, that he wished for a support for his declining years. He refused at
first. But on his father pressing more urgently, he caused him to become
wavering in his mind, whether to yield rather to duty or to love. By
hammering on and teazing him, at last the old man gained his point; and
betrothed him to the daughter of our next-door neighbor here
(<i>pointing to the house of <span class =
"charname">Phidippus</span></i>). This did not seem so very disagreeable
to Pamphilus, until on the very point of marriage, when he saw that all
was ready, and that no respite was granted, but marry he must; then, at
last, he took it so much to heart, that I do believe if Bacchis had been
present, <i>even</i> she would have pitied him. Whenever opportunity was
afforded for us being alone, so that he could converse with me, <i>he
used to say</i>: “Parmeno, I&nbsp;am ruined! What have I done! Into what
misery have I plunged myself! Parmeno, I&nbsp;shall never be able to
endure this. To my misery, I&nbsp;am undone!”</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phil.</span> (<i>vehemently exclaiming.</i>)
May the Gods and Goddesses confound you, Laches, for vexing him so!</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Par.</span> To cut the matter short, he took
home his wife. On the first night, he did not touch the girl; the night
that followed that, not a bit the more.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phil.</span> What is it you tell me? A young
man go to bed with a virgin, intoxicated to boot, <i>and</i> able to
restrain himself from touching her! You do not say what’s likely; nor do
I believe it to be the truth.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Par.</span> I suppose it does seem so to
you, for no one comes to you unless he is eager for you; <i>but</i> he
had married her against his will.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phil.</span> After this, what followed?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Par.</span> In a very few days after,
Pamphilus took me aside, away from the house, and told me how that the
young woman was still untouched by him; and <i>how</i> that before he
had taken her home as his wife, he had hoped to be able to endure this
<span class = "pagenum">264</span>
marriage: “But, Parmeno, as I can not resolve to live with her any
longer, it is neither honorable in me, nor of advantage to the young
woman herself, for her to be turned to ridicule, but rather I ought to
return her to her relations just as I received her.”</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phil.</span> You tell me of a conscientious
and virtuous disposition in Pamphilus.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Par.</span> “For me to declare this, I
consider to be inconvenient to me, but for her to be sent back to her
father without mentioning any blame, would be insolent; but I am in
hopes that she, when she is sensible that she can not live with me, will
go at last <i>of her own accord</i>.”</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phil.</span> What <i>did he do</i> in the
mean while? Used he to visit Bacchis?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Par.</span> Every day. But as <i>usually</i>
is the case, after she saw that he belonged to another, she immediately
became more ill-natured and more peevish.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phil.</span> I’faith, that’s not to be
wondered at.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Par.</span> And this circumstance in
especial contributed to estrange him from her; after he had fairly
examined himself, and her, and the one that was at home, he formed a
judgment, by comparison, upon the principles of them both. She, just as
might be expected from a person of respectable and free birth, chaste
<i>and</i> virtuous, patient under the slights and all the insults of
her husband, and concealing his affronts. Upon this, his mind, partly
overcome by compassion for his wife, partly constrained by the insolence
of the other, was gradually estranged from Bacchis, and transferred its
affections to the other, after having found a congenial disposition. In
the mean time, there dies at Imbros<a class = "tag" name = "hec_tag28"
id = "hec_tag28" href = "#hec_note28">28</a> an old man, a&nbsp;relative
of theirs. His property there devolved on them by law. Thither his
father drove the love-sick Pamphilus, much against his will. He left his
wife here with his mother, for the old man has retired into the country;
he seldom comes into the city.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phil.</span> What is there yet in this
marriage to prevent its being lasting?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Par.</span> You shall hear just now. At
first, for several days, there really was a good understanding between
them. In the
<span class = "pagenum">265</span>
mean time, however, in a strange way, she began to take a dislike to
Sostrata; nor yet was there ever any quarrel or words between them.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phil.</span> What then?</p>

race is this! what a conspiracy this! that all women should desire and
reject every individual thing alike! And not a single one can you find
to swerve in any respect from the disposition of the rest. For instance,
quite as though with one accord, do all mothers-in-law hate their
daughters-in-law. Just in the same way is it their system to oppose
their husbands; their obstinacy <i>here</i> is the same. In the very
same school they all seem to me to have been trained up to perverseness.

<p><span class = "charname">Lach.</span> You, undeservedly? Can any
thing possibly be said that you deserve in return for this conduct of
yours?
<span class = "pagenum">267</span>
You, who are disgracing both me and yourself and the family, <i>and</i>
are laying up sorrow for your son. Then besides, you are making our
connections become, from friends, enemies to us, who have thought him
deserving for them to intrust their children<a class = "tag" name =
"hec_tag32" id = "hec_tag32" href = "#hec_note32">32</a> to him. You
alone have put yourself forward, by your folly, to be causing this
disturbance.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sos.</span> What, I?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Lach.</span> You, woman, I say, who take me
to be a stone, not a man. Do you think because it’s my habit to be so
much in the country, that I don’t know in what way each person is
passing his life here? I&nbsp;know much better what is going on here
than there, where I am daily; for this reason, because, just as you act
at home, I&nbsp;am spoken of abroad. Some time since, indeed,
I&nbsp;heard that Philumena had taken a dislike to you; nor did I the
least wonder at it; indeed, if she hadn’t done so, it would have been
more surprising. But I did not suppose that she would have gone so far
as to hate even the whole of the family; if I had known <i>that</i>, she
should have remained here in preference, <i>and</i> you should have gone
away. But consider how undeservedly these vexations arise on your
account, Sostrata; I&nbsp;went to live in the country, in compliance
with your request, and to look after my affairs, in order that my
circumstances might be able to support your lavishness and comforts, not
sparing my own exertions, beyond what’s reasonable and my time of life
allows. That you should take no care, in return for all this, that there
should be nothing to vex me!</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sos.</span> Upon my word, through no means
or fault of mine has this taken place.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Lach.</span> Nay, <i>through you</i> in
especial; you were the only person here; on you alone, Sostrata, falls
all the blame. You ought to have taken care of matters here, as I had
released you from other anxieties. Is it not a disgrace for an old woman
to pick a quarrel with a girl? You will say it was her fault.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Sos.</span> Indeed I do not say so, my
<i>dear</i> Laches.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Lach.</span> I am glad of that, so may the

<p><span class = "charname">Sos.</span> How do you know, my husband,

it not proof sufficient, when yesterday no one was willing to admit you
into the house, when you went to see her?</p>

very ill just then; for that reason I was not admitted to her.</p>

more her malady than any thing else; and with good reason in fact, for
there is not one of you but wants her son to take a wife; and the match

they have married, <i>then</i>, at your solicitation, they are to put

good nature corrupt their minds. And if you would do the same, it would
be more for your own interest and ours. At present I see that you are

<p><span class = "charname">Phid.</span> Just look at that, now!</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Lach.</span> I waited on you yesterday about
your daughter; you sent me away just as wise as I came. It does not
become you, if you wish this alliance to continue, to conceal your

clearing ourselves, or excusing it, we shall remedy these matters for
you, yourself the judge. But if this is the cause of detaining her at
your house, because she is ill, <i>then</i> I think that you do me an
injustice, Phidippus, if you are afraid lest she should <i>not</i> be
attended with sufficient care at my house. But, so may the Gods prosper
me, I&nbsp;do not yield in this to you, although you are her father,
that you can wish her well more than <i>I do</i>, and that on my son’s
account, who I
<span class = "pagenum">269</span>

anxious for her to return to you, if I possibly can by any means effect
it.</p>

impatient to return home? O, how much more preferable had it been for me
to pass my life any where in the world than to return here and be
sensible that I am thus wretched! For all of us know who have met with
trouble from any cause, that all the time that passes before we come to
the knowledge of it, is so much gain.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Par.</span> Still, as it is, you’ll the
sooner know how to extricate yourself from these misfortunes. If you had
not returned, this breach might have become much wider; but now,
Pamphilus, I&nbsp;am sure that both will be awed by your presence. You
will learn the facts, remove their enmity, restore them to good feeling
once again. <i>These</i> are but trifles which you have persuaded
yourself are <i>so</i> grievous.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Pam.</span> Why comfort me? Is there a
person in all the world so wretched as <i>I</i>? Before I took her to
wife, I&nbsp;had my heart engaged by other affections. Now, though on
this subject I should be silent, it is easy for any one to know how much
I have suffered; yet I never dared refuse her whom my father forced upon
me. With difficulty did I withdraw myself from another, and disengage my
affections so firmly rooted there! and hardly had I fixed them in
another quarter, when, lo! a&nbsp;new misfortune has arisen, which
<span class = "pagenum">271</span>
may tear me from her too. Then besides, I&nbsp;suppose that in this
matter I shall find either my mother or my wife in fault; and when I
find such to be the fact, what remains but to become still more
wretched? For duty, Parmeno, bids me bear with the feelings of a mother;
then, to my wife I am bound by obligations; with so much temper did she
formerly bear my usage, and on no occasion disclose the many wrongs
<i>inflicted on her</i> by me. But, Parmeno, something of consequence,
I&nbsp;know not what it is, must have happened for <i>this</i>
misunderstanding to have arisen between them, that has lasted so
long.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Par.</span> Or else something frivolous,
i’faith, if you would only give words their proper value; those which
are sometimes the greatest enmities, do not argue the greatest injuries;
for it often happens that in certain circumstances, in which another
would not even be out of temper, for the very same reason a passionate
man becomes your greatest enemy. What enmities do children entertain
among themselves for trifling injuries! For what reason? Why, because
they have a weak understanding to direct them. Just so are these women,
almost like children with their fickle feelings; perhaps a single word
has occasioned this enmity between them, master.</p>

which I so hastily betook myself, in extreme agitation, out of doors.
For just now, when, full of alarm, I&nbsp;rushed into the house,
expecting to find my wife afflicted with some other malady than what I
have found it to be;&mdash;ah me! immediately the servant-maids beheld
that I had

to my sorrow, I&nbsp;found out her malady; for neither did the time
afford any interval to enable her to conceal it, nor could she complain
in any other accents than <i>those which</i> the case itself prompted.
When I perceived <i>this</i>: “O disgraceful conduct!” I&nbsp;exclaimed,

an incredible and shocking circumstance. Her mother followed me; just as
I got to the threshold, she threw herself on her knees: I&nbsp;felt
compassion for her. Assuredly it is the fact, in my opinion, just as
matters befall us all, so are we elated or depressed. At once she began
to address me in these words: “O my <i>dear</i> Pamphilus, you see the
reason why she left your house; for violence was offered to her when
formerly a maid, by some villain to us unknown. Now, she took refuge
here then, that from you and others she might conceal her labor.” But
when I call to mind her entreaties, I&nbsp;can not, wretched as I am,
refrain from tears. “Whatever chance or fortune it is,” said she, “which
has brought you here to-day, by it we do both conjure you, if with
equity and justice we may, that her misfortune may be concealed by you,
and kept a secret from all. If ever you were sensible, my <i>dear</i>
Pamphilus, that she was tenderly disposed toward you, she now asks you
to grant her this favor in return, without making any difficulty of it.
But as to taking her back, act quite according to your own convenience.
You alone are aware of her lying-in, and that the child is none of
yours. For it is said that it was two months after the marriage before
she had commerce with you. And then, this is but the seventh month since
she came to you.<a class = "tag" name = "hec_tag41" id = "hec_tag41"
href = "#hec_note41">41</a> That you are sensible of this, the
circumstances themselves prove. Now, if it is possible, Pamphilus,
<span class = "pagenum">276</span>
I especially wish, and will use my endeavors, that her labor may remain
unknown to her father, and to all, in fact. But if that can not be
managed, and they do find it out, I&nbsp;will say that she miscarried;
I&nbsp;am sure no one will suspect otherwise than, what is so likely,
the child was by you. It shall be instantly exposed; in that case there
is no inconvenience whatever to yourself, and you will be concealing an
outrage so undeservingly committed upon her,<a class = "tag" name =
"hec_tag42" id = "hec_tag42" href = "#hec_note42">42</a> poor thing!”
I&nbsp;promised <i>this</i>, and I am resolved to keep faith in what I
said. But as to taking her back, really I do not think that would be at
all creditable, nor will I do so, although love for her, and habit, have
a strong influence upon me. I&nbsp;weep when it occurs to my mind, what
must be her life, and <i>how great</i> her loneliness in future.
O&nbsp;Fortune, thou hast never been found constant! But by this time
<i>my</i> former passion has taught me experience in the present case.
The means by which I got rid of that, I&nbsp;must employ on the present
occasion. Parmeno is coming with the servants; it is far from convenient
that he should be here under present circumstances, for he was the only
person to whom I trusted the secret that I kept aloof from her when I
first married her. I&nbsp;am afraid lest, if he should frequently hear
her cries, he might find out that she is in labor. He must be dispatched
by me somewhere till Philumena is delivered.</p>

that with reason no slight might possibly be committed by your family;

favorably of me. And that through no fault of mine this separation has
taken place, I&nbsp;call the Gods to witness. But since she considers
that it is not befitting her to give way to my mother, and with
readiness to conform to her temper, and as on no other terms it is
possible for good feeling to exist between them, either my mother must
be separated, Phidippus, from me, or else Philumena. Now affection urges

occasionally, is it not more kind in us to conceal our knowledge of it,
than to do our best to be aware of it, in consequence of which he will

that there would be no agreement between us in future, why should I take
her back?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Lach.</span> The young woman has done what
her mother persuaded her. Is that to be wondered at? Do you suppose you
can find any woman who is free from fault? Or is it that men have no
failings?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phid.</span> Do you yourselves now consider,
Laches, and you, Pamphilus, whether it is most advisable for you to
leave her or take her back. What your wife may do, is not in my control.
Under neither circumstance will you meet with any difficulty from me.
But what are we to do with the child?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Lach.</span> You do ask an absurd question;
whatever happens, send him back his <i>child</i> of course, that we may
bring it up as ours.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Pam.</span> (<i>in a low voice.</i>) A child
which the father has abandoned, am I to rear?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Lach.</span> What was it you said?
How&mdash;not rear it, Pamphilus? Prithee, are we to expose it, in
preference? What madness is this? Really, I&nbsp;can not now be silent
any longer. For you force me to say in his presence (<i>pointing to
<span class = "charname">Phidippus</span></i>) what I would rather not.
Do you suppose I am in ignorance <i>of the cause</i> of your tears, or
what it is on account of which you are perplexed to this degree? In the
first place, when you alleged as a reason, that, on account of your
mother, you could not have your wife at home, she promised that she
would leave the house. Now, since you see this pretext as well taken
away from you, because a child has been born without your knowledge, you
have got another. You are mistaken if you suppose that I am ignorant of
your feelings. That at last you might prevail upon your feelings to take
this step, how long a period for loving a mistress did I allow you! With
what patience did I bear the expense you were at in keeping her!
I&nbsp;remonstrated with you and entreated you to take a wife.
I&nbsp;said that it was time: by my persuasion you married. What you
then did in obedience to me, you did as became you. Now again you have
set your fancy upon a
<span class = "pagenum">290</span>
mistress, and, to gratify her, you do an injury to the other as well.

<p><span class = "charname">Lach.</span> Your own self, and you act

your wife has perceived it too; for what other reason had she for
leaving you?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phid.</span> (<i>to himself.</i>) It’s clear

<p><span class = "charname">Pam.</span> It is not the time at

<p><span class = "charname">Pam.</span> (<i>apart.</i>) In every way I

I save for him, when it was nearly perishing through the agency of these
<i>women</i> and of himself: a&nbsp;wife, whom he thought that he must
cast off forever, I&nbsp;restore <i>to him</i>: from the suspicion that
he lay under with his father and Phidippus, I&nbsp;have cleared him.
This ring, in fact, was the cause of these discoveries being made. For I
remember, that about ten months ago, at an early hour of night, he came
running home to my house, out of breath, without a companion, and
surcharged with wine,<a class = "tag" name = "hec_tag61" id =
"hec_tag61" href = "#hec_note61">61</a> with this ring <i>in his
hand</i>. I&nbsp;felt alarmed immediately: “My Pamphilus,” I&nbsp;said,
“prithee, my dear, why thus breathless, or where did you get that
ring?&mdash;tell me!” He <i>began</i> to pretend that he was thinking of
something else. When I saw <i>that</i>, I&nbsp;began to suspect I know
not what, <i>and</i> to press him still more to tell me. The fellow
confessed that he had ravished <i>some female</i>, he knew not whom, in
the street; and said, that while she was struggling, he had taken that
ring away from her. Myrrhina here recognized it just now, while I had it
on my finger. She asked whence it came: I&nbsp;told her all the story.
Hence the discovery has been made that it was Philumena ravished by him,
and that this new-born child is his. I&nbsp;am overjoyed that this
happiness has befallen him through my agency; although other courtesans
would not have similar feelings; nor, indeed, is it to our interest that
any lover should find pleasure in matrimony. But, i’faith, I&nbsp;never,
for the sake of gain, will give my mind to base actions. So long as I
had the opportunity, I&nbsp;found him to be kind, easy, and
good-natured. This marriage has fallen out unluckily for me,&mdash;that
I confess to be the fact. But, upon my word, I&nbsp;do think that I have
done nothing for it to befall me deservedly. It is but reasonable to
endure inconveniences from one from whom I have received so many
benefits.</p>

same sense in the first line of the Eunuch. This is evidently the
Prologue spoken on the second attempt to bring forward the piece. On the
first occasion it probably had none. “Vitium” was a word used by the
Augurs, with whom it implied an unfavorable omen, and thence came to be
used for any misfortune or disaster. He seems to mean the depraved taste
of the public, that preferred exhibitions of rope-dancers and pugilists
to witnessing his Plays.</p>

<i>Cæcilius</i>)&mdash;Ver. 14. Colman has the following Note: “A famous
Comic Poet among the Romans. His chief excellences are said to have
been, the gravity of his style and the choice of his subjects. The first
quality was attributed to him by Horace, Tully, etc., and the last by
Varro. ‘In argumentis Cæcilius poscit palmam, in ethesi Terentius.’ ‘In
the choice of subjects, Cæcilius demands the preference; in the manners,
Terence.’” Madame Dacier, indeed, renders “in argumentis,” “in the
disposition of his subjects.” But the words will not bear that
construction. “Argumentum,” I&nbsp;believe, is uniformly used for the
argument itself, and never implies the conduct of it; as in the Prologue
to the Andrian, “non tam dissimili argumento.” Besides, the disposition
of the subject was the very art attributed by the critics of those days
to Terence, and which Horace mentions in the very same line with the
gravity of Cæcilius, distinguishing them as the several characteristics
of each writer, “Vincere Cæcilius gravitate, Terentius arte.”</p>

<p><a name = "hec_note20" id = "hec_note20" href = "#hec_tag20">20.</a>
<i>Vauntings of boxers</i>)&mdash;Ver. 33. Horace probably had this
passage in his mind when he penned the First Epistle in his Second Book,
l. 185; where he mentions the populace leaving a Play in the midst for
the sight of a bear, or an exhibition of boxers.</p>

<p><a name = "hec_note21" id = "hec_note21" href = "#hec_tag21">21.</a>
<i>Of a rope-dancer</i>)&mdash;Ver. 34. The art of dancing on the tight
rope was carried to great perfection among the ancients. Many paintings
have been discovered, which show the numerous attitudes which the
performers assumed. The figures have their heads enveloped in skins or
caps, probably intended as a protection in case of falling. At the
conclusion of the performance the dancer ran down the rope. Germanicus
and Galba are said to have exhibited elephants dancing on the tight
rope.</p>

<p><a name = "hec_note22" id = "hec_note22" href = "#hec_tag22">22.</a>
<i>The old custom of mine</i>)&mdash;Ver. 38. He says that on the second
representation he followed the plan which he had formerly adopted in the
Plays of Cæcilius, of bringing those forward again which had not given
satisfaction at first.</p>

<p><a name = "hec_note23" id = "hec_note23" href = "#hec_tag23">23.</a>
<i>Fight for their places</i>)&mdash;Ver. 41. This was in consequence of
their sitting indiscriminately at the Amphitheatre, where the gladiators
were exhibited; whereas at the Theatres there were distinct places
appropriated to each “ordo” or class.</p>

<p><a name = "hec_note24" id = "hec_note24" href = "#hec_tag24">24.</a>
<i>Gracing the scenic festival</i>)&mdash;Ver. 45. Madame Dacier remarks
that there is great force and eloquence in the Actor’s affecting a
concern for the sacred festivals, which were in danger of being deprived
of their chief ornaments, if by too great a severity they discouraged
the Poets who undertook to furnish the Plays during the solemnity.</p>

<p><a name = "hec_note25" id = "hec_note25" href = "#hec_tag25">25.</a>
<i>At my own expense</i>)&mdash;Ver. 57. It is generally supposed that
“meo pretio” means “a price named as my estimate;” and that it was the
custom for the Ædiles to purchase a Play of a Poet at a price fixed by
the head of the company of actors. It is also thought that the money was
paid to the actor, who handed over the whole, or a certain part, to the
Poet, and if the Play was not received with favor, the Ædiles had the
right to ask back the money from the actor, who consequently became a
loser by the transaction. Pareus and Meric Casaubon think, however, that
in case of this Play, the Ædiles had purchased it from the Poet, and the
performers had bought it of the Ædiles as a speculation. What he means
at the end of the First Prologue by selling the Play over again, is not
exactly known. Perhaps if the Play had been then performed throughout
and received with no favor, he would have had to forfeit the money, and
lose all right to any future pecuniary interest in it; but he preferred
to cancel the whole transaction, and to reserve the Play for purchase
and representation at a more favorable period.</p>

<i>Don’t say so, Parmeno</i>)&mdash;Ver. 109. She says this ironically,
at the same time intimating that she knows Parmeno too well, not to be
sure that he is as impatient to impart the secret to her as she is to
know it. Donatus remarks, that she pretends she has no curiosity to hear
it, that he may deem her the more worthy to be intrusted with the
secret.</p>

<p><a name = "hec_note30" id = "hec_note30" href = "#hec_tag30">30.</a>
<i>With a certain stranger</i>)&mdash;Ver. 195. Here Philotis gives a
reason, as Donatus observes, why she does not again appear in the Play.
The following is an extract from Colman’s remarks on this passage: “It
were to be wished, for the sake of the credit of our author’s
acknowledged <i>art</i> in the Drama, that Philotis had assigned as good
a reason for her appearing at all. Eugraphius justly says: ‘The
Courtesan in this Scene is a character quite foreign to the fable.’
Donatus also says much the same thing in his Preface, and in his first
Note to this Comedy; but adds that ‘Terence chose this method rather
than to relate the argument by means of a Prologue, or to introduce a
God speaking from a machine. I&nbsp;will venture to say that the Poet
might have taken a much shorter and easier method than either;
I&nbsp;mean, to have begun the Play with the very Scene which now opens
the Second Act.’”</p>

<p><a name = "hec_note31" id = "hec_note31" href = "#hec_tag31">31.</a>
<i>Scene I.</i>)&mdash;Colman has the following observations on this
Scene: “Donatus remarks that this Scene opens the intention of Terence
to oppose the generally-received opinion, and to draw the character of a
good step-mother. It would, therefore, as has been already observed,
have been a very proper Scene to begin the Play, as it carries us
immediately into the midst of things; and we can not fail to be
interested when we see the persons acting so deeply interested
themselves. We gather from it just so much of the story as is necessary
for our information at first setting out. We are told of the abrupt
departure of Philumena, and are witnesses of the confusion in the two
families of Laches and Phidippus. The absence of Laches, which had been
in great measure the occasion of this misunderstanding, is also very
artfully mentioned in the altercation between him and Sostrata. The
character of Laches is very naturally drawn. He has a good heart, and a
testy disposition, and the poor old gentleman is kept in such constant
perplexity that he has perpetual occasion to exert both those
qualities.”</p>

<p><a name = "hec_note32" id = "hec_note32" href = "#hec_tag32">32.</a>
<i>Intrust their children</i>)&mdash;Ver. 212. The plural “liberos,”
children, is used where only one is being spoken of, similarly, in the
Heautontimorumenos, l. 151.</p>

<p><a name = "hec_note33" id = "hec_note33" href = "#hec_tag33">33.</a>
<i>If he comes to know</i>)&mdash;Ver. 262. Donatus observes that the
Poet shows his art in here preparing a reason to be assigned by
Pamphilus for his pretended discontent at the departure of his wife.</p>

<p><a name = "hec_note34" id = "hec_note34" href = "#hec_tag34">34.</a>
<i>Ha! Sostrata</i>)&mdash;Ver. 271. Colman observes on this passage:
“This is extremely artful. The answer of Philumena, as related by
Phidippus, contains an ample vindication of Pamphilus. What, then, can
we suppose could make the house so disagreeable to her in his absence,
but the behavior of Sostrata? She declares her innocence; yet
appearances are all against her. Supposing this to be the first Act of
the Play, it would be impossible for a Comedy to open in a more
interesting manner.”</p>

<p><a name = "hec_note35" id = "hec_note35" href = "#hec_tag35">35.</a>
<i>And carry word</i>)&mdash;Ver. 314. It was the custom with the Greeks

to inform their wives of their arrival.</p>

<p><a name = "hec_note36" id = "hec_note36" href = "#hec_tag36">36.</a>
<i>Was in alarm about</i>)&mdash;Ver. 321. “Pavitare.” Casaubon has a
curious suggestion here; he thinks it not improbable that he had heard
the female servants whispering among themselves that Philumena
“paritare,” “was about to be brought to bed,” which he took for
“pavitare,” “was in fear” of something.</p>

<p><a name = "hec_note37" id = "hec_note37" href = "#hec_tag37">37.</a>
<i>Heavy punishment</i>)&mdash;Ver. 335. Probably meaning that he will
be examined by torture, whether he has not, by drugs or other means,
contributed to Philumena’s illness.</p>

<p><a name = "hec_note38" id = "hec_note38" href = "#hec_tag38">38.</a>
<i>And thee, Health</i>)&mdash;Ver. 338. She invokes Æsculapius, the God
of Medicine, and “Salus,” or “Health,” because, in Greece, their statues
were always placed near each other; so that to have offered prayers to
one and not to the other, would have been deemed a high indignity. On
the worship of Æsculapius, see the opening Scene of the Curculio of
Plautus.</p>

<p><a name = "hec_note39" id = "hec_note39" href = "#hec_tag39">39.</a>
<i>An intermitting one</i>)&mdash;Ver. 357. “Quotidiana;” literally,
“daily.”</p>

<p><a name = "hec_note40" id = "hec_note40" href = "#hec_tag40">40.</a>
<i>All of them change</i>)&mdash;Ver. 369. This must have been
imaginary, as they were not likely to be acquainted with the reason of
Philumena’s apprehensions.</p>

<p><a name = "hec_note41" id = "hec_note41" href = "#hec_tag41">41.</a>
<i>Since she came to you</i>)&mdash;Ver. 394. There is great doubt what
is the exact meaning of “postquam ad te venit,” here,&mdash;whether it
means, “it is now the seventh month since she became your wife,” or, “it
is now the seventh month since she came to your embraces,” which did not
happen for two months after the marriage. The former is, under the
circumstances, the most probable construction.</p>

<p><a name = "hec_note42" id = "hec_note42" href = "#hec_tag42">42.</a>
<i>Committed upon her</i>)&mdash;Ver. 401. Colman very justly observes
here: “it is rather extraordinary that Myrrhina’s account of the injury
done to her daughter should not put Pamphilus in mind of his own
adventure, which comes out in the Fifth Act. It is certain that had the
Poet let the Audience into that secret in this place, they would have
immediately concluded that the wife of Pamphilus and the lady whom he
had ravished were one and the same person.” Playwrights have never, in
any age or country, troubled themselves much about probability in their
plots. Besides, his adventure with Philumena was by no means an uncommon
one. We find similar instances mentioned by Plautus; and violence and
debauchery seem almost to have reigned paramount in the streets at
night.</p>

<p><a name = "hec_note43" id = "hec_note43" href = "#hec_tag43">43.</a>
<i>Thirty days or more</i>)&mdash;Ver. 421. In his voyage from Imbros to
Athens, namely, which certainly appears to have been unusually long.</p>

<p><a name = "hec_note44" id = "hec_note44" href = "#hec_tag44">44.</a>
<i>To the citadel</i>)&mdash;Ver. 431. This was the fort or citadel that
defended the Piræus, and being three miles distant from the city, was
better suited for the design of Pamphilus, whose object it was to keep
Parmeno for some time at a distance.</p>

<p><a name = "hec_note45" id = "hec_note45" href = "#hec_tag45">45.</a>
<i>He would rupture me</i>)&mdash;Ver. 435. He facetiously pretends to
think that Pamphilus may, during a storm at sea, have vowed to walk him
to death, if he should return home.</p>

<p><a name = "hec_note46" id = "hec_note46" href = "#hec_tag46">46.</a>
<i>Regardful of a parent</i>)&mdash;Ver. 448. Colman observes here:
“This reflection seems to be rather improper in this place, for the
discovery of Philumena’s labor betrayed to Pamphilus the real motive of
her departure; after which discovery his anxiety proceeds entirely from
the supposed injury offered him, and his filial piety is from that
period made use of merely as a pretense.”</p>

<p><a name = "hec_note47" id = "hec_note47" href = "#hec_tag47">47.</a>
<i>He lived well</i>)&mdash;Ver. 461. This is living well in the sense
used by the “Friar of orders gray.” “Who leads a good life is sure to
live well.”</p>

<p><a name = "hec_note48" id = "hec_note48" href = "#hec_tag48">48.</a>
<i>Brought home nothing more</i>)&mdash;Ver. 462. Colman remarks that
this passage is taken notice of by Donatus as a particularly happy
stroke of character; and indeed the idea of a covetous old man gaping
for a fat legacy, and having his mouth stopped by a moral precept, is
truly comic.</p>

<p><a name = "hec_note49" id = "hec_note49" href = "#hec_tag49">49.</a>
<i>Pay back her portion</i>)&mdash;Ver. 502. As was universally done on
a separation by agreement.</p>

<p><a name = "hec_note50" id = "hec_note50" href = "#hec_tag50">50.</a>
<i>At the right time</i>)&mdash;Ver. 531. Lemaire observes that, from
this passage, it would appear that the Greeks considered seven months
sufficient for gestation. So it would appear, if we are to take the time
of the Play to be seven, and not nine, months after the marriage; and,
as before observed, the former seems to be the more reasonable
conclusion.</p>

<p><a name = "hec_note51" id = "hec_note51" href = "#hec_tag51">51.</a>
<i>A ring which</i>)&mdash;Ver. 574. Colman remarks that this
preparation for the catastrophe by the mention of the ring, is not so
artful as might have been expected from Terence; as in this soliloquy he
tells the circumstances directly to the Audience.</p>

<p><a name = "hec_note52" id = "hec_note52" href = "#hec_tag52">52.</a>
<i>And festive days</i>)&mdash;Ver. 592. “Festos dies.” The days for
sacrificing to particular Divinities, when she would have the
opportunity of meeting her friends, and making herself merry with
them.</p>

<p><a name = "hec_note53" id = "hec_note53" href = "#hec_tag53">53.</a>
<i>Look forward with impatience to my death</i>)&mdash;Ver. 596. Colman
says: “This idea of the long life of a step-mother being odious to her
family, is applied in a very beautiful and uncommon manner by
Shakspeare:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "poem">
<p>“Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour</p>

<p>Another morn; but oh, methinks how slow</p>

<p><a name = "hec_note54" id = "hec_note54" href = "#hec_tag54">54.</a>
<i>The old man and the old woman</i>)&mdash;Ver. 621. “Senex atque
anus.” In these words he probably refers to the commencement of many of
the stories current in those times, which began: “There were once upon a
time an old man and an old woman.” Indeed, almost the same words occur
in the Stichus of Plautus, l. 540, at the commencement of a story: “Fuit
olim, quasi ego sum, senex,” “There was upon a time an old man, just
like me.”</p>

<p><a name = "hec_note55" id = "hec_note55" href = "#hec_tag55">55.</a>
<i>Still take the child</i>)&mdash;Ver. 638. In cases of separation it
was customary for the father to have the care of the male children.</p>

<p><a name = "hec_note56" id = "hec_note56" href = "#hec_tag56">56.</a>
<i>But should you like</i>)&mdash;Ver. 725. Donatus observes that
Phidippus utters these words with an air of disinclination to be present
at the conference; and, indeed, the characters are well sustained, as it
would not become him coolly to discourse with a courtesan, whom he
supposes to have alienated Pamphilus from his daughter, although he
might very properly advise it, as being likely to conduce to the peace
of both families.</p>

<p><a name = "hec_note57" id = "hec_note57" href = "#hec_tag57">57.</a>
<i>Kept Pamphilus at a distance</i>)&mdash;Ver. 752. Colman observes,
how are we to reconcile this with the words of Parmeno at the beginning
of the Play, where he says that Pamphilus visited Bacchis daily; and he
inquires whether we are to suppose that Bacchis, who behaves so candidly
in every other instance, wantonly perjures herself in this, or that the
Poet, by a strange infatuation attending him in this Play, contradicts
himself<ins class = "correction" title = "text has superfluous close quote">? </ins>To this it may be answered, that as Bacchis appears to be
so scrupulous in other instances, it is credible that, notwithstanding
his visits, she may not have allowed him to share her embraces.</p>

<p><a name = "hec_note58" id = "hec_note58" href = "#hec_tag58">58.</a>
<i>Other courtesans avoid doing</i>)&mdash;Ver. 777. Colman has the
following quotation from Donatus: “Terence, by his uncommon art, has
attempted many innovations with great success. In this Comedy, he
introduces, contrary to received prejudices, a&nbsp;good step-mother and
an honest courtesan; but at the same time he so carefully assigns their
motives of action, that by him alone every thing seems reconcilable to
truth and nature; for this is just the opposite of what he mentions in
another place, as the common privilege of all Poets, ‘to paint good
matrons and wicked courtesans.’” Perhaps the same good feeling prompted
Terence, in showing that a mother-in-law and a courtesan could be
capable of acting with good and disinterested feelings, which caused
Cumberland to write his Play of “The Jew,” to combat the popular
prejudice against that persecuted class, by showing, in the character of
Sheva, that a Jew might possibly be a virtuous man.</p>

<p><a name = "hec_note59" id = "hec_note59" href = "#hec_tag59">59.</a>
<i>Have been unjustly suspected</i>)&mdash;Ver. 778. The words here
employed are also capable of meaning, if an active sense is given to
“suspectas,” “our wives have entertained wrong suspicions;” but the
sense above given seems preferable, as being the meaning of the
passage.</p>

<p><a name = "hec_note60" id = "hec_note60" href = "#hec_tag60">60.</a>
<i>Run with all speed</i>)&mdash;Ver. 809. Donatus remarks, that Parmeno
is drawn as being of a lazy and inquisitive character; and that Terence,
therefore, humorously contrives to keep him always on the move, and in
total ignorance of what is going on.</p>

<p><a name = "hec_note61" id = "hec_note61" href = "#hec_tag61">61.</a>
<i>Surcharged with wine</i>)&mdash;Ver. 824. Cooke has this remark here:
“I suppose that this is the best excuse the Poet could make for the
young gentleman’s being guilty of felony and rape at the same time. In
this speech, the incident is related on which the catastrophe of the
Play turns, which incident is a very barbarous one, and attended with
more than one absurdity, though it is the occasion of an agreeable
discovery.”</p>

<p><a name = "hec_note62" id = "hec_note62" href = "#hec_tag62">62.</a>
<i>In the Comedies</i>)&mdash;Ver. 867.&mdash;Madame Dacier observes on
this passage: “Terence here, with reason, endeavors to make the most of
a circumstance peculiar to his Play. In other Comedies, every body,
Actors as well as Spectators, are at last equally acquainted with the
whole intrigue and catastrophe, and it would even be a defect in the
plot were there any obscurity remaining. But Terence, like a true
genius, makes himself superior to rules, and adds new beauties to his
piece by forsaking them. His reasons for concealing from part of the
personages of the Drama the principal incident of the plot, are so
plausible and natural, that he could not have followed the beaten track
without offending against manners and decency. This bold and uncommon
turn is one of the chief graces of the Play.”</p>

<p><a name = "hec_note63" id = "hec_note63" href = "#hec_tag63">63.</a>
<i>From the shades below</i>)&mdash;Ver. 876. Parmeno says this, while
pondering upon the meaning of all that is going on, and thereby
expresses his impatience to become acquainted with it. He therefore
repeats what Pamphilus has before said in the twelfth line of the
present Act, about his having been restored from death to life by his
agency.</p>

<p><a name = "hec_note64" id = "hec_note64" href = "#hec_tag64">64.</a>
<i>Your applause</i>)&mdash;Ver. 881. We may here remark, that the
Hecyra is the only one of the Plays of Terence with a single plot.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Chremes</span> and Demipho are two aged
Athenians, brothers. Nausistrata, the wife of Chremes, is a wealthy
woman, possessed of large estates in the island of Lemnos. Chremes, who
goes thither yearly to receive the rents, meets with a poor woman there,
whom he secretly marries, and has by her a daughter called Phanium:
while engaged in this intrigue, Chremes passes at Lemnos by the name of
Stilpho. By his wife, Nausistrata, at Athens, Chremes has a son, named
Phædria, and his brother has a son, named Antipho. Phanium having now
arrived at her fifteenth year, the two brothers privately agree that she
shall be brought to Athens and married to Antipho. For this purpose,
Chremes goes to Lemnos, while Demipho is obliged to take a journey to
Cilicia. On departing, they leave their sons in the care of Geta, one of
Demipho’s servants. Shortly afterward, Phædria falls in love with a
Music-girl, but, from want of means, is unable to purchase her from her
owner. In the mean time, the Lemnian wife of Chremes, urged by poverty,
embarks for Athens, whither she arrives with her daughter and her nurse.
Here they inquire for Stilpho, but in vain, as they can not find any one
of that name. Shortly after, the mother dies, and Antipho, seeing
Phanium by accident, falls in love with her. Being wishful to marry her,
he applies to Phormio, a&nbsp;Parasite, for his advice. The latter hits
upon the following scheme: there being a law at Athens, which obliges
the next-of-kin to female orphans, either to marry them or give them a
portion, the Parasite pretends that he is a friend of Phanium, and
insists that Antipho is her nearest relation, and is consequently bound
to marry her. Antipho is summoned before a court of justice, and it
being previously arranged, allows judgment to be given against himself,
and immediately marries Phanium. Shortly after, the old men return upon
the same day, and are much vexed, the one on finding that his son has
married a woman without a fortune, the other that he has lost the
opportunity of getting his daughter advantageously married. In the mean
time, Phædria being necessitated to raise some money to purchase the
Music-girl, Geta and Phormio arrange that the former shall pretend to
the old man that Phormio has consented to take back the woman whom
Antipho has married, if Demipho will give her a portion of thirty minae.
Demipho borrows the money of Chremes, and pays it to Phormio, who hands
it over to Phædria, and Phædria to Dorio, for his mistress. At this
conjuncture, it becomes known who Phanium really is, and the old men are
delighted to find that Antipho has married the very person they wished.
They attempt, however, to get back the thirty minae from Phormio, and
proceed to threats and violence. On this, Phormio, who has accidentally
learned the intrigue of Chremes with the woman of Lemnos, exposes him,
and relates the whole story to his wife, Nausistrata; on which she
censures her husband for his bad conduct, and the Play concludes with
her thanks to Phormio for his information.</p>

<h5>THE SUMMARY OF C. SULPITIUS APOLLINARIS.</h5>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Demipho</span>, the brother of Chremes, has
gone abroad, his son Antipho being left at Athens. Chremes has secretly
a wife and a daughter at Lemnos, another wife at Athens, and an only
son, who loves a Music-girl. The mother arrives at Athens from Lemnos,
<i>and there</i> dies. The girl, her orphan daughter, (Chemes being
away,) arranges the funeral. After Antipho has fallen in love with her
when seen there, through the aid of the Parasite he receives her as his
wife. His father and Chremes, having <i>now</i> returned, <i>begin</i>
to be enraged. Afterward they give thirty minæ to the Parasite, that he
may take her <i>as his own</i> wife. With this money the Music-girl is
bought <i>for Phædria</i>. Antipho <i>then</i> keeps his wife, who has
been recognized by his uncle.</p>

not withdraw <i>our</i> bard from his pursuits and reduce him to
indolence, he endeavors, by invectives, to deter him from writing: for
he is wont to say to this effect,&mdash;that the Plays which he has
hitherto composed are poor in their language, and of meagre style:
because he has nowhere described a frantic youth as seeing a hind in
flight, and the hounds pursuing; while he implores<a class = "tag" name

entreated that he would give her aid. But if he had been aware that
<i>his Play</i>, when formerly first represented, stood its ground more
through the merits of the performers than its own, he would attack with
much less boldness than he does. Now, if there is any one who says or
thinks to this effect, that if the old Poet had not assailed him first,
the young one could have devised no Prologue for him to repeat, without
having some one to abuse, let him receive this for an answer: “that the
prize is proposed in common to all who apply to the Dramatic art.” He
has aimed at driving our Poet from his studies to <i>absolute</i> want;
he <i>then</i> has intended this for an answer, not an attack. If he had
opposed him with fair words, he would have heard himself civilly
addressed; what has been given by him, let him consider as <i>now</i>
returned. I&nbsp;will make an end of speaking about him, when, of his
own accord, he himself makes an end of offending. Now give your

call “Epidicazomenos,”<a class = "tag" name = "phor_tag19" id =

calls it “Phormio;” because the person that acts the principal part is

damsel, a&nbsp;Music-girl, <i>and</i> fell in love with her to
distraction. She belonged to a most abominable Procurer; and their
fathers had taken good care that they should have nothing to give him.
There remained nothing for him then but to feed his eyes, to follow her
about, to escort her to the school,<a class = "tag" name = "phor_tag30"
id = "phor_tag30" href = "#phor_note30">30</a> and to escort her back
again. We, having nothing to do, lent our aid to Phædria. Near the
school at which she was taught, right opposite the
<span class = "pagenum">309</span>
place, there was a certain barber’s shop: here we were generally in the
habit of waiting for her, until she was coming home again. In the mean
time, while <i>one day</i> we were sitting there, there came in a young
man in tears;<a class = "tag" name = "phor_tag31" id = "phor_tag31" href
= "#phor_note31">31</a> we were surprised at this. We inquired what was
the matter? “Never,” said he, “has poverty appeared to me a burden so
grievous and so insupportable as just now. I&nbsp;have just seen a
certain poor young woman in this neighborhood lamenting her dead mother.
She was laid out before her, and not a single friend, acquaintance, or
relation was there with her, except one poor old woman, to assist her in
the funeral: I&nbsp;pitied her. The girl herself was of surpassing
beauty.” What need of a long story? She moved us all. At once Antipho
<i>exclaims</i>, “Would you like us to go and visit her?” The other
<i>said</i>, “I think we ought&mdash;let us go&mdash;show us the way,
please.” We went, and arrived <i>there</i>; we saw her; the girl was
beautiful, and that you might say so the more, there was no heightening
to her beauty; her hair disheveled, her feet bare, herself neglected,
and in tears; her dress mean, so that, had there not been an excess of
beauty in her very charms, these circumstances must have extinguished
those charms. The one who had lately fallen in love with the Music-girl
said: “She is well enough;” but our <i>youth</i>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dav.</span> I know it already&mdash;fell in
love with her.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Geta.</span> Can you imagine to what an
extent? Observe the consequence. The day after, he goes straight to the
old woman; entreats her to let him have her: she, on the other hand,
refuses him, and says that he is not acting properly; that she is a
citizen of Athens, virtuous, and born of honest <i>parents</i>: that if
he wishes to make her his wife, he is at liberty to do so according to
law; but if otherwise, she gives him a refusal. Our <i>youth</i> was at
a loss what to do. He was both eager to marry her, and he dreaded his
absent father.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">310</span>
<p><span class = "charname">Dav.</span> Would not his father, if he had
returned, have given him leave?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Geta.</span> He let him marry a girl with no
fortune, and of obscure birth! He would never do <i>so</i>.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dav.</span> What came of it at last?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Geta.</span> What came of it? There is one
Phormio here, a&nbsp;Parasite, a&nbsp;fellow of great assurance; may all
the Gods confound him!</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dav.</span> What has he done?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Geta.</span> He has given this piece of
advice, which I will tell you of. “There is a law, that orphan girls are
to marry those who are their next-of-kin; and the same law commands such
persons to marry them. I’ll say you are the next-of-kin, and take out a
summons<a class = "tag" name = "phor_tag32" id = "phor_tag32" href =
"#phor_note32">32</a> against you; I’ll pretend that I am a friend of
the girl’s father; we will come before the judges: who her father was,
who her mother, how she is related to you&mdash;all this I’ll trump up,
just as will be advantageous and suited to my purpose; on your
disproving none of these things, I&nbsp;shall prevail, of course. Your
father will return; a&nbsp;quarrel will be the consequence; what care I?
She will still be ours.”</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dav.</span> An amusing piece of
assurance!</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Geta.</span> He was persuaded to this. It
was carried out; they came <i>into court</i>: we were beaten. He has
married her.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dav.</span> What is it you tell me?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Geta.</span> Just what you have heard.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dav.</span> O Geta, what will become of
you?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Geta.</span> Upon my faith, I don’t know;
this one thing I do know, whatever fortune may bring, I’ll bear it with
firmness.</p>

So may the Gods kindly bless me, could I be at liberty to be so long in
possession of the object of my love, I&nbsp;could contentedly die. Do
you, then, form a judgment as to the rest, what I am now suffering from
this privation, and what pleasure you enjoy from the possession of your
desires; not to mention how, without <i>any</i> expense, you have
obtained a well-born and genteel woman, and have got a wife of

guilty of any fault, in consequence of which he has been too regardless
of his interest or his reputation, I&nbsp;would not allege any reason
why he should not suffer what he deserves. But if some one by chance,
relying upon his own artfulness, has laid a snare for our youthful age,
and has succeeded, is it our fault or <i>that</i> of the judges, who
often, through envy, take away from the rich, or, through compassion,

embarrassed me in my plans. For if I offer my daughter in marriage to
any person that’s a stranger, it must all be told how and by whom I had
her. You I knew to be fully as faithful to me as I am to myself; if a
stranger shall think fit to be connected with me by marriage, he will
hold his tongue, just as long as good terms exist between us: but if he
takes a dislike to me, he’ll be knowing more than it’s proper he should
know. I&nbsp;am afraid, too, lest my wife should, by some means, come to

one half, when he understood me; he was quite delighted; complimented
me; asked where the old man was; gave thanks to the Gods that an
opportunity was afforded him for showing himself no less a friend to
Phædria than to Antipho: I&nbsp;bade the fellow wait for me at the
Forum; whither I would bring the old gentleman. But see, here’s the very
man (<i>catching sight of the Old Man</i>). Who is the further one?
Heyday, Phædria’s father has got back! still, brute beast that I am,
what was I afraid of? Is it because two are presented instead of one for
me to dupe? I&nbsp;deem it preferable to enjoy a two-fold hope. I’ll try

her.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Chrem.</span> I understand.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Geta.</span> It seemed to me that I might
first sound him; I&nbsp;took the fellow aside: “Phormio,” said I, “why
don’t we try to settle these matters between us rather with a good grace
than with a bad one? <i>My</i> master’s a generous <i>man</i>, and one
who hates litigation; but really, upon my faith, all his friends were
just now advising him with one voice to turn her instantly out of
doors.”</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Ant.</span> (<i>apart.</i>) What is he
about? Or where is this to end at last?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Geta</span> (<i>continuing the supposed

he turns her out? That has been already inquired into: aye, aye, you’ll
have enough to do, if you engage with him; he is so eloquent. But
suppose he’s beaten; still, however, it’s not his life, but his money
that’s at stake.” After I found that the fellow was influenced by these
words, I&nbsp;said: “We are now by ourselves here; come now, what should
you like to be given you, money down, to drop this suit with my master,
so that she may betake herself off, <i>and</i> you annoy us no
more?”</p>

that’s fair and reasonable, as he is a reasonable man, you’ll not have
to bandy three words with him.”</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Chrem.</span> Go on with your story.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Geta.</span> At first the fellow raved.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dem.</span> Say, what did he ask?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Geta.</span> What? A great deal too
much.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">338</span>
<p><span class = "charname">Chrem.</span> How much? Tell me.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Geta.</span> Suppose he were to give a great
talent.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dem.</span> Aye, faith, perdition <i>to him
rather</i>; has he no shame?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Geta.</span> Just what I said to him:
“Pray,” <i>said I</i>, “suppose he was portioning an only daughter of
his own. It has been of little benefit that he hasn’t one of his own,
when another has been found to be demanding a fortune.” To be brief, and
to pass over his impertinences, this at last was his final answer: “I,”
said he, “from the very first, have been desirous to marry the daughter
of my friend, as was fit I should; for I was aware of the ill results of
this, a&nbsp;poor wife being married into a rich family, and becoming a
slave. But, as I am now conversing with you unreservedly, I&nbsp;was in
want of <i>a wife</i> to bring me a little money with which to pay off
my debts; and even yet, if Demipho is willing to give as much as I am to
receive with her to whom I am engaged, there is no one whom I should
better like for a wife.”</p>

Ridiculous; are you afraid that I sha’n’t do what I have once

this? Formerly, when she might have been handsomely <i>disposed of</i>,

How say you? (<i>addressing <span class =

to the dead.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Dem.</span> For he did this neither through

age makes people behave themselves decently? Are my looks and my age

<p><span class = "charname">Phor.</span> (<i>aside.</i>) But really,

Phædria. (<i>To <span class = "charname">Nausistrata</span>.</i>) Hark

<p><span class = "charname">Phor.</span> (<i>aside.</i>) Heyday! what
means this? I’ve met with Socrates, not Phædria, so far as I see. Why
hesitate to go up and address him? (<i>Accosting him.</i>) How now,
Phædria, whence have you acquired this new wisdom, and derived such
great delight, as you show by your countenance?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phæd.</span> O welcome, <i>my</i>

matter.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phæd.</span> Aye, faith, I have to beg of

of noble birth, and rich.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phor.</span> What is it you tell me? Are you

<p><span class = "charname">Phæd.</span> Upon my faith, I’m saying

<p><span class = "charname">Phor.</span> Yes, and this, too, is a true
saying: “You’ll have no great difficulty in believing that to be true,
which you greatly wish <i>to be so</i>.”</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phæd.</span> Nay, but do listen, I beg of
you, to all the wonderful things I have to tell you of. It was while
thinking of this to myself, that I just now burst forth into those
expressions which you heard&mdash;that we, and what relates to us, are
ruled by the sanction of the Gods, <i>and</i> not by blind chance.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phor.</span> I’ve been for some time in a

<p><span class = "charname">Phæd.</span> Do you know Phanocrates?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phor.</span> As well as <i>I do</i>
yourself.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phæd.</span> The rich man?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">363</span>
<p><span class = "charname">Phor.</span> I understand.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phæd.</span> He is the father of Pamphila.
Not to detain you, these were the circumstances: Calchas was his
servant, a&nbsp;worthless, wicked fellow. Intending to run away from the
house, he carried off this girl, whom her father was bringing up in the
country, <i>then</i> five years old, and, secretly taking her with him
to Eubæa, sold her to Lycus, a&nbsp;merchant. This person, a&nbsp;long
time after, sold her, when now grown up, to Dorio. She, however, knew
that she was the daughter of parents of rank, inasmuch as she
recollected herself being attended <i>and</i> trained up by female
servants: the name of her parents she didn’t recollect.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phor.</span> How, then, were they
discovered?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phæd.</span> Stay; I was coming to that.
This runaway was caught yesterday, and sent back to Phanocrates: he
related the wonderful circumstances I have mentioned about the girl, and
how she was sold to Lycus, and afterward to Dorio. Phanocrates sent
immediately, and claimed his daughter; but when he learned that she had
been sold, he came running to me.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phor.</span> O, how extremely fortunate!</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phæd.</span> Phanocrates has no objection to
my marrying her; nor has my father, I&nbsp;imagine.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phor.</span> Trust me for that; I’ll have
all this matter managed for you; Phormio has so arranged it, that you
shall not be a suppliant to your father, but his judge.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phæd.</span> You are joking.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phor.</span> So it is, I tell you. Do you
only <i>give me</i> the thirty minæ which Dorio&mdash;</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phæd.</span> You put me well in mind; I
understand you; you may have them; for he must give them back, as the
law forbids a free woman to be sold; and, on my faith, I&nbsp;do rejoice
that an opportunity is afforded me of rewarding you, and taking a hearty
vengeance upon him; a&nbsp;monster of a fellow! he has feelings more
hardened than iron.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phor.</span> Now, Phædria, I return you
thanks; I’ll make you a return upon occasion, if ever I have the
opportunity. You impose a heavy task upon me, to be contending with you
in good offices, as I can not in wealth; and in affection and zeal,
I&nbsp;must repay you what I owe. To be surpassed in deserving well, is
a disgrace to a man of principle.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">364</span>
<p><span class = "charname">Phæd.</span> Services badly bestowed,
I&nbsp;take to be disservices. But I do not know any person more
grateful and more mindful <i>of a service</i> than yourself. What is it
you were just now mentioning about my father?</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phor.</span> There are many particulars,
which at present I have not the opportunity to relate. Let’s go
in-doors, for Nausistrata has invited me to dinner, and I’m afraid we
may keep them waiting.</p>

<p><span class = "charname">Phæd.</span> Very well; follow me. (<i>To

to mean that this was the fourth Play composed by Terence; it is,
however, more generally supposed that the meaning is, that it was acted
four times in one year.</p>

the Hecyra.</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note18" id = "phor_note18" href =
"#phor_tag18">18.</a>
<i>While one implored</i>)&mdash;Ver. 8. “Et eam plorare, orare ut
subveniat sibi.” This is probably in allusion to some absurd passage in
one of the Plays of Lavinius. It is generally supposed to mean, that the
stag implores the young man; but as the youth is mad, the absurdity, of
the passage is heightened if we suppose that he implores the stag, and,
in the moment of its own danger, entreats it to come to his own
assistance; as certainly the Latin will admit of that
interpretation.&mdash;Ovid has a somewhat similar passage in the Pontic
Epistles, B. ii. Ep. ii. l. 39: “The hind that, in its terror, is flying
from the savage dogs, hesitates not to trust itself to the neighboring
house.”</p>

which is the foundation of the plot.</p>

called their “demensum.”</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note23" id = "phor_note23" href =
"#phor_tag23">23.</a>
<i>Will be struck</i>)&mdash;Ver. 48. “Ferietur.” “To strike”
a&nbsp;person for a present was said when it was extorted from him
reluctantly. So in the Trinummuns of Plautus, l. 247, “Ibi illa
pendentem ferit.” “Then does she strike while he is wavering.”</p>

birth of their children.</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note25" id = "phor_note25" href =
"#phor_tag25">25.</a>
<i>Initiate him</i>)&mdash;Ver. 49. It is not known what initiation is
here referred to. Madame Dacier thinks it was an initiation into the
great mysteries of Ceres, which was commonly performed while children
were yet very young; others suggest that it means the period of weaning
the child, and initiating it into the use of another kind of diet.
Donatus says, that Varro speaks of children being initiated into the
mysteries of the Deities Edulia, Potica, and Cuba, the Divinities of
Eating, Drinking, and Sleeping.</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note26" id = "phor_note26" href =

misfortune overtook him, he had been abandoned by his Genius.</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note28" id = "phor_note28" href =
"#phor_tag28">28.</a>
<i>Kick against the spur</i>)&mdash;Ver. 78. “To kick against the
pricks,” or “in spite of the spur,” was a common Greek proverb. The
expression occurs in the New Testament, Acts ix. 5. “It is hard for thee
to kick against the pricks.”</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note29" id = "phor_note29" href =
"#phor_tag29">29.</a>
<i>To make your market</i>)&mdash;Ver. 79. This is a metaphorical
expression taken from traffic, in which merchants suit themselves to the
times, and fix a price on their commodities, according to the course of
the market.</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note30" id = "phor_note30" href =
"#phor_tag30">30.</a>
<i>To the school</i>)&mdash;Ver. 86. It was the custom for the
“lenones,” or “procurers,” to send their female slaves to music-schools,
in order to learn accomplishments. So in the Prologue to the Rudens of
Plautus: “This Procurer brought the maiden to Cyrene hither.
A&nbsp;certain Athenian youth, a&nbsp;citizen of this city, beheld her
us she was going home from the music-school.”</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note31" id = "phor_note31" href =
"#phor_tag31">31.</a>
<i>Young man in tears</i>)&mdash;Ver. 92. In the Play of Apollodorus, it
was the barber himself that gave the account how he had just returned
from cutting off the young woman’s hair, which was one of the usual
ceremonies in mourning among the Greeks. Donatus remarks, that Terence
altered this circumstance that he might not shock a Roman audience by a
reference to manners so different from their own.</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note32" id = "phor_note32" href =
"#phor_tag32">32.</a>
<i>Take out a summons</i>)&mdash;Ver. 127. “Dica” was the writ or
summons with which an action at law was commenced.</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note33" id = "phor_note33" href =
"#phor_tag33">33.</a>
<i>Usher to the Music-girl</i>)&mdash;Ver. 144. This is said satirically
of Phaedria, who was in the habit of escorting the girl to the
music-school. It was the duty of the “pædagogi,” or “tutors,” to lead
the children to school, who were placed under their care. See the speech
of Lydus, the pædagogus of Pistoclerus, in the Bacchides of Plautus, Act
iii. Sc.&nbsp;3, where, enlarging upon his duties, he mentions this
among them.</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note34" id = "phor_note34" href =

divorce her.</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note35" id = "phor_note35" href =
"#phor_tag35">35.</a>
<i>Neither right</i>)&mdash;Ver. 176. No right to get rid of her in
consequence of the judgment which, at the suit of Phormio, has been
pronounced against him; nor yet, right to keep her, because of his
father insisting upon turning her out of doors.</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note36" id = "phor_note36" href =
"#phor_tag36">36.</a>
<i>Be washing a brickbat</i>)&mdash;Ver. 187. “Laterem lavare,” “to wash
a brick,” or “tile,” was a proverb signifying labor in vain, probably
because (if the brick was previously baked) it was impossible to wash
away the red color of it. According to some, the saying alluded to the
act of washing a brick which had been only dried in the sun, in which
case the party so doing both washed away the brick and soiled his own
fingers.</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note37" id = "phor_note37" href =
"#phor_tag37">37.</a>
<i>Here in reserve</i>)&mdash;Ver. 230. “Succenturiatus.” The
“succenturiati” were, properly, men intrusted to fill up vacancies in
the centuries or companies, when thinned by battle.</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note38" id = "phor_note38" href =
"#phor_tag38">38.</a>
<i>Let alone “authority”</i>)&mdash;Ver. 232. “Ac mitto imperium.”
Cicero has quoted this passage in his Epistles to Atticus, B. ii. Ep.
19.</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note39" id = "phor_note39" href =
"#phor_tag39">39.</a>
<i>When affairs are the most prosperous</i>)&mdash;Ver. 241. Cicero
quotes this passage in the Third Book of his Tusculan Questions, and the
maxim here inculcated was a favorite one with the Stoic
philosophers.</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note40" id = "phor_note40" href =
"#phor_tag40">40.</a>
<i>Any giving evidence</i>)&mdash;Ver. 293. Slaves were neither allowed
to plead for themselves, nor to give evidence. See the Curculio of
Plautus, l.&nbsp;621, and the Notes to the Andria.</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note41" id = "phor_note41" href =
"#phor_tag41">41.</a>
<i>Given her a portion</i>)&mdash;Ver. 297. By this remark, Donatus
observes that Terence artfully prepares us for the imposition of
Phormio, who extorts money from the old gentleman on this very
ground.</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note42" id = "phor_note42" href =
"#phor_tag42">42.</a>
<i>While you were living</i>)&mdash;Ver. 302. There was a law at Athens
which enacted that persons who lent money to young men in the lifetime
of their parents should have no power to recover it. In line 303 of the
Pseudolus, Plautus alludes to the Quinavicenarian or Lætorian Law, at
Rome, which forbade credit to be given to persons under the age of
twenty-five years, and deprived the creditor of all right to recover his
money or goods.</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note43" id = "phor_note43" href =
"#phor_tag43">43.</a>
<i>The woman’s next friend</i>)&mdash;Ver. 307. The “patronus” was the
person who undertook to conduct a lawsuit for another.</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note44" id = "phor_note44" href =
"#phor_tag44">44.</a>
<i>Salute the household Gods</i>)&mdash;Ver. 311. It was the custom for
those returning from a voyage or journey, to give thanks to their
household Gods for having protected them in their absence. Thus, in the
Amphitryon of Plautus, Jupiter, while personating Amphitryon, pretends,
in l. 983, that he is going to offer sacrifice for his safe return.</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note45" id = "phor_note45" href =
"#phor_tag45">45.</a>
<i>And so you say</i>)&mdash;Ver. 315. Donatus tells the following story
with reference to this passage: “This Play being once rehearsed before
Terence and some of his most intimate acquaintances, Ambivius, who acted
the part of Phormio, came in drunk, which threw the author into a
violent passion; but Ambivius had scarcely repeated a few lines,
stammering and scratching his head, before Terence became pacified,
declaring that when he was writing these very lines, he had exactly such
a Parasite as Ambivius then represented, in his thoughts.”</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note46" id = "phor_note46" href =
"#phor_tag46">46.</a>
<i>Have hashed it up</i>)&mdash;Ver. 318. He is thought to allude here,
figuratively, to the composition of a dish called “moretum,” (in praise
of which Virgil wrote a poem) which was composed of garlic, onions,
cheese, eggs, and other ingredients, beaten up in a mortar. The allusion
to eating is appropriately used in an address to a Parasite.</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note47" id = "phor_note47" href =
"#phor_tag47">47.</a>
<i>Turn upon myself</i>)&mdash;Ver. 323. Donatus observes that in this
Scene Terence exhibits the lower order of Parasites, who ingratiated
themselves by sharping and roguery, as in the Eunuchus he describes
Parasites of a higher rank, and of a newer species, who obtained their
ends by flattery.</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note48" id = "phor_note48" href =
"#phor_tag48">48.</a>
<i>In the stocks at last</i>)&mdash;Ver. 325. “In nervum crumpat
denique.” There are several interpretations suggested for these words.
Some think they allude to the drawing of a bow till it breaks; but they
are more generally thought to imply termination in corporal punishment.
“Nervus” is supposed to have been the name of a kind of stocks used in
torturing slaves, and so called from being formed, in part at least, of
the sinews of animals.</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note49" id = "phor_note49" href =
"#phor_tag49">49.</a>
<i>They will take you</i>)&mdash;Ver. 334. At Rome, insolvent debtors

<i>To his patron</i>)&mdash;Ver. 338. “Regi.” The Parasites were in the
habit of calling their patron “Rex,” their “King.”</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note51" id = "phor_note51" href =
"#phor_tag51">51.</a>
<i>At free cost</i>)&mdash;Ver. 339. “Asymbolum.” Without having paid
his “symbola,” or “club,” for the entertainment. Donatus informs us that
the whole of this passage is borrowed from one of Ennius, which is still
preserved.</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note52" id = "phor_note52" href =
"#phor_tag52">52.</a>
<i>First to drink</i>)&mdash;Ver. 342. To be the first to drink, and to
take the higher place on the couch when eating, was the privilege of the
most honored guests, who usually bathed, and were then anointed before
the repast.</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note53" id = "phor_note53" href =
"#phor_tag53">53.</a>
<i>Banquet full of doubts</i>)&mdash;Ver. 342. “Coena dubia.” Horace,
who borrows many of his phrases from Terence, uses the same
expression.</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note54" id = "phor_note54" href =
"#phor_tag54">54.</a>
<i>Since you reign alone</i>)&mdash;Ver. 605. This is a remark well put
into the mouth of an Athenian, as the public were very jealous of any
person becoming paramount to the laws, and to prevent it, were
frequently guilty of the most odious oppression.</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note55" id = "phor_note55" href =
"#phor_tag55">55.</a>
<i>So many minds</i>)&mdash;Ver. 454. “Quot homines, tot sententiæ.”
This is a famous adage. One similar to the succeeding one is found in
the Second Eclogue of Virgil, l. 65: “Trahit sua quemque voluptas,”
exactly equivalent to our saying, “Every man to his taste.”</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note56" id = "phor_note56" href =
"#phor_tag56">56.</a>
<i>Must deliberate further</i>)&mdash;Ver. 457. “Amplius deliberandum.”
This is probably a satirical allusion to the judicial system of
procrastination, which, by the Romans, was called “ampliatio.” When the
judges could not come to a satisfactory conclusion about a cause, they
signified it by the letters N.&nbsp;L. (for “non liquet,” “it is not
clear”), and put off the suit for a rehearing.</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note57" id = "phor_note57" href =
"#phor_tag57">57.</a>
<i>Much more at a loss</i>)&mdash;Ver. 459. See the Poenulus of Plautus,
where advocates or assistants are introduced among the Dramatic Personæ.
Colman has the following remarks on this quaint passage: “I&nbsp;believe
there is no Scene in Comedy more highly seasoned with the
<i>ridiculous</i> than this before us. The idea is truly comic, and it
is worked up with all that simplicity and chastity so peculiar to the
manner of Terence. An ordinary writer would have indulged himself in
twenty little conceits on this occasion; but the dry gravity of Terence
infinitely surpasses, as true humor, all the drolleries which, perhaps,
even those great masters of Comedy, Plautus or Molière, might have been
tempted to throw out. It is the highest art of a Dramatic Author, on
some occasions, to leave a good deal to the Actor; and it has been
remarked by Heinsius and others, that Terence was particularly attentive
to this circumstance.”</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note58" id = "phor_note58" href =

<i>From his place of exercise</i>)&mdash;Ver. 484. “Palæstra.” He
alludes to the Procurer’s house under this name.</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note59" id = "phor_note59" href =
"#phor_tag59">59.</a>
<i>Befall his own safety</i>)&mdash;Ver. 490. Overhearing Phædria
earnest and determined, and the Procurer obstinate and inflexible,
Antipho and Geta join in apprehending that the brutality of the latter
may provoke Phædria to some act of violence.</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note60" id = "phor_note60" href =
"#phor_tag60">60.</a>
<i>With fine words</i>)&mdash;Ver. 499. “Phaleratis dictis.” “Phaleræ”
were, properly, the silver ornaments with which horses were decked out,
and being only for show, and not for use, gave rise to this saying.
“Ductes” was an obscene word, and not likely to be used by any but such
characters as Dorio.</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note61" id = "phor_note61" href =
"#phor_tag61">61.</a>
<i>A wolf by the ears</i>)&mdash;Ver. 505. A&nbsp;proverbial expression
which, according to Suetonius, was frequently in the mouth of Tiberius
Cæsar.</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note62" id = "phor_note62" href =
"#phor_tag62">62.</a>
<i>A word to the wise</i>)&mdash;Ver. 540. “Dictum sapienti sat est.”
The same proverb is found in the Persa of Plautus, l. 736.</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note63" id = "phor_note63" href =
"#phor_tag63">63.</a>
<i>To shake myself</i>)&mdash;Ver. 585. “Me excutiam.” In reference to
the custom of the Greeks, and the Eastern nations, of shaking their
clothes at the door of any house which they were going to leave.</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note64" id = "phor_note64" href =
"#phor_tag64">64.</a>
<i>Rely on at home</i>)&mdash;Ver. 586. “Nam ego meorum solus sum meus.”
He means that he is the only person in his house friendly to himself,
inasmuch as his wife, from her wealth, has supreme power over the
domestics, in whom he himself can place no trust.</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note65" id = "phor_note65" href =
"#phor_tag65">65.</a>
<i>Good terms with him</i>)&mdash;Ver. 635. Meaning, “Is he in his
senses or not?”</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note66" id = "phor_note66" href =
"#phor_tag66">66.</a>
<i>Amount of his life</i>)&mdash;Ver. 660. “Quid si animam debet?”
Erasmus tells us that this was a proverb among the Greeks applied to
those who ran so deeply in debt, that their persons, and consequently,
in one sense, their very existence, came into the power of their
creditors.</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note67" id = "phor_note67" href =
"#phor_tag67">67.</a>
<i>Six hundred actions</i>)&mdash;Ver. 667. “Sescentos;” literally, “six
hundred.” The Romans used this term as we do the words “ten thousand,”
to signify a large, but indefinite number.</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note68" id = "phor_note68" href =
"#phor_tag68">68.</a>
<i>A strange black dog</i>)&mdash;Ver. 705. This omen, Plautus calls, in
the Casina, l. 937, “canina scæva.”</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note69" id = "phor_note69" href =
"#phor_tag69">69.</a>
<i>Through the sky-light</i>)&mdash;Ver. 706. So in the Amphitryon of
Plautus, l. 1108, two great snakes come down through the “impluvium,” or
“sky-light.” On the subject of the “impluvium,” see the Notes to the
Miles Gloriosus of Plautus, l.&nbsp;159.</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note70" id = "phor_note70" href =
"#phor_tag70">70.</a>
<i>A hen crowed</i>)&mdash;Ver. 707. Donatus tells us that it was a
saying, that in the house where a hen crowed, the wife had the upper
hand.</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note71" id = "phor_note71" href =
"#phor_tag71">71.</a>
<i>The soothsayer&mdash;the diviner</i>)&mdash;Ver. 708. According to
some accounts there was this difference between the “hariolus” and the
“aruspex,” that the former foretold human events, the latter those
relating to the Deities. Donatus has remarked on these passages, that
Terence seems to sneer at the superstitions referred to.</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note72" id = "phor_note72" href =
"#phor_tag72">72.</a>
<i>Can find them now</i>)&mdash;Ver. 726. His Lemnian wife and daughter.
Colman remarks: “This is intended as a transition to the next Scene; but
I think it would have been better if it had followed without this kind
of introduction. The Scene itself is admirable, and is, in many places,
both affecting and comic, and the discovery of the real character of
Phanium is made at a very proper time.”</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note73" id = "phor_note73" href =
"#phor_tag73">73.</a>
<i>My daughter’s nurse</i>)&mdash;Ver. 735. Among the ancients, it was
the custom for nurses who had brought up children to remain with them in
after-life.</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note74" id = "phor_note74" href =
"#phor_tag74">74.</a>
<i>Where are the ladies?</i>)&mdash;Ver. 748. “Ubi illæ?” literally,
“Where are these women?”</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note75" id = "phor_note75" href =
"#phor_tag75">75.</a>
<i>Run beyond the house</i>)&mdash;Ver. 767. “Fugias ne præter casam.”
This passage has given much trouble to the Commentators; but it is
pretty clear that the explanation of Donatus is the correct one: “Don’t
abandon your own home,” that being the safest place. Stallbaum agrees
with Gronovius in thinking that it was first applied as a piece of
advice to runaway slaves, as being likely to become worse off by the
change; probably much in the same spirit as we say, “Out of the
frying-pan into the fire.”</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note76" id = "phor_note76" href =
"#phor_tag76">76.</a>
<i>Paying by borrowing</i>)&mdash;Ver. 779. “Versura solvere,” was “to
pay a debt by borrowing money,” and consequently to be no better off
than before. Geta having, by the money he has procured, freed Phædria
from all danger of losing his mistress, but at the same time having
brought Antipho into still greater danger of losing his wife.</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note77" id = "phor_note77" href =
"#phor_tag77">77.</a>
<i>Or his talking</i>)&mdash;Ver. 782. “Ejus” here alludes, not to
Nausistrata but to Phormio. Madame Dacier suggests that it should be
“hujus.”</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note78" id = "phor_note78" href =
"#phor_tag78">78.</a>
<i>With your money</i>)&mdash;Ver. 785. Colman observes: “Alluding to
the money borrowed of her to pay Phormio; and as Donatus observes in
another place, it is admirably contrived, in order to bring about a
humorous catastrophe that Chremes should make use of his wife’s money on
this occasion.”</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note79" id = "phor_note79" href =
"#phor_tag79">79.</a>
<i>Our friend’s</i>)&mdash;Ver. 811. Chremes himself is so called, to
deceive Nausistrata.</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note80" id = "phor_note80" href =
"#phor_tag80">80.</a>
<i>O good luck</i>)&mdash;Ver. 840. “Fors fortuna,” “good fortune;”
while “fortuna” merely means “chance.”</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note81" id = "phor_note81" href =
"#phor_tag81">81.</a>
<i>Throwing my cloak</i>)&mdash;Ver. 843. When expedition was required,
it was usual to throw the ends of the “pallium,” or “cloak,” over the
shoulders.</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note82" id = "phor_note82" href =
"#phor_tag82">82.</a>
<i>Carry me off</i>)&mdash;Ver. 881. Madame Dacier says that Antipho is
so rejoiced here at Geta’s news, that he jumps upon his shoulders, and
is carried off in triumph, which was a sort of stage-trick, and was very
diverting to the Audience. On this, Colman observes: “I believe Madame
Dacier has not the least foundation for this extraordinary piece of
information; and I must confess, that I have too high an opinion, both
of the Roman audience and actors, to believe it to be true.”</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note83" id = "phor_note83" href =
"#phor_tag83">83.</a>
<i>That as to what</i>)&mdash;Ver. 898. Lemaire suggests that he is
about to say: “that as to what was agreed upon between us, I&nbsp;may
take home this young woman, and make her my wife.”</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note84" id = "phor_note84" href =
"#phor_tag84">84.</a>
<i>Is she not genteel-looking</i>)&mdash;Ver. 904. Patrick has the
following note here: “One can not conceive any thing more happy or just
than these words of Chremes. Demipho’s thoughts are wholly taken up how
to recover the money, and Phormio is equally solicitous to retain it;
but Chremes, who had just left his daughter, is regardless of their
discourse, and fresh from the impressions which she had made on him,
longs to know if his brother’s sentiments of her were equally favorable,
and naturally puts this paternal question to him.”</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note85" id = "phor_note85" href =
"#phor_tag85">85.</a>
<i>Transferred to my account</i>)&mdash;Ver. 921. “Rescribere argentum,”
or “nummos,” meant “to transfer,” or “set down money to the account of
another person in one’s banker’s books.” A&nbsp;passage in the Asinaria
of Plautus, l. 445, seems to have the same meaning.</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note86" id = "phor_note86" href =
"#phor_tag86">86.</a>
<i>For the well portioned</i>)&mdash;Ver. 939. Though Colman thinks
otherwise, it is pretty clear that he alludes to Nausistrata in these
words.</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note87" id = "phor_note87" href =
"#phor_tag87">87.</a>
<i>To be carrying off</i>)&mdash;Ver. 954. Patrick has the following
note here: “The different characters of the two brothers are admirably
preserved throughout this Scene. Chremes stands greatly in awe of his
wife, and will submit to any thing rather than the story should come to
her ears; but Demipho can not brook the thoughts of losing so much
money, and encourages his brother to behave with spirit and resolution,
promising to make up matters between him and his wife.”</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note88" id = "phor_note88" href =
"#phor_tag88">88.</a>
<i>Dead and gone</i>)&mdash;Ver. 965. “E medio excedere,” was an
Euphemism signifying “to die,” which it was deemed of ill omen to
mention.</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note89" id = "phor_note89" href =
"#phor_tag89">89.</a>
<i>Those who have</i>)&mdash;Ver. 1025. He here uses the terms which it
was customary to employ in the celebration of a public funeral. See also
the form of proclaiming an auction, at the end of the Menæchmi of
Plautus.</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note90" id = "phor_note90" href =
"#phor_tag90">90.</a>
<i>Have him victimised</i>)&mdash;Ver. 1027. “Mactatus” was the term
applied to the pouring of wine and frankincense on the victim about to
be sacrificed, on which it was said to be “magis auctus,” “increased,”
or “amplified;” which, in time, became corrupted into the word
“mactatus,” or “mactus.”</p>

<p><a name = "phor_note91" id = "phor_note91" href =
"#phor_tag91">91.</a>
<i>Grant us your applause</i>)&mdash;Ver. 1054. Thus concludes the last,
and certainly not the least meritorious of the Plays of our Author;
indeed, for genuine comic spirit, it may challenge comparison with the
Eunuch, which is in general considered to be the best.</p>
